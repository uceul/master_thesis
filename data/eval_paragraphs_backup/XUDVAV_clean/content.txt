1 was synthesized as purple-red crystals by a solvothermal method from CoO (7.5 mg, 0.10 mmol) and H3BPT (15 mg, 0.05 mmol) in a mixture solution of N, N′-dimethylformamide (DMF, 1.0 mL) and water (0.5 mL) in a 20 ml Parr Teflon-lined stainless steel vessel at 100 °C for 48 h. Crystals of 1 were collected in 48% yield (based on H3BPT ligand). Calcd for Co3C39H41O18N3: C, 46.08%; H, 4.07%; N, 4.13%. Found: C, 46.03%; H, 4.09%; N, 4.04%. Its structure and composition were further confirmed by powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) (Fig. S1), elemental analysis, infrared (IR) spectroscopy, and thermogravimetry analysis (TGA). Furthermore, the magnetic property of compound 1 was investigated.
