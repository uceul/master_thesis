
The mixture of Zn(NO3)2·6H2O (0.0297 g, 0.1 mmol), H4btec (0.0254 g, 0.1 mmol) and btmb (0.0316 g, 0.1 mmol) was dissolved in 12 mL of distilled water. The pH value was then adjusted to 6.0 with 1 M NaOH solution and the resulting mixture was transferred and sealed in a 25 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel vessel. This was then heated at 150 °C for 3 days and cooled to room temperature at 10 °C h−1. Colourless crystals of 1 were collected in 51% yield (based on Zn). Elemental analysis (%) calcd for C23H21ZnN6O6: C 50.89, H 3.90, N 15.48. Found: C 50.73, H 3.83, N 15.86.
