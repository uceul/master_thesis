Synthesis of 1 (Solvothermal Method): A mixture of Co(NO3)2·6H2O (0.12 mmol, 35 mg), NaN3 (0.2 mmol, 13 mg), and bib (0.1 mmol, 21 mg) was suspended in the solvent mixture (H2O/CH3OH = 3:4, 12 mL). After addition of nitrate acid solution (0.5 mL of a 68 % solution), the suspension was heated in a Teflon‐lined autoclave (25 mL) at 140 °C for 2 d. After the autoclave was cooled to room temperature at 10 °C h–1, pink block crystals suitable for single‐crystal X‐ray crystallographic analysis were collected in ca. a 10 % yield (based on bib). C24H20CoN12O3 (583.43): calcd. C 49.41, H 3.46, N 28.81; found C 49.20, H 3.51, N 28.93. IR (KBr):  = 3124 (m), 2379 (w), 2066 (s), 1738 (w), 1646 (w), 1527 (s), 1490 (m), 1347 (s), 1301 (m), 1258 (m), 1114 (w), 1066 (m), 957 (w), 930 (w), 868 (w), 830 (m), 764 (w), 738 (w), 661 (m), 610 (w), 545 (w), 488 (w) cm–1.
