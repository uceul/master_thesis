Synthesis of [Zn6(m-O3S-Ph-PO3)4(4,4‘-bipy)6(H2O)4]·18H2O (3). A mixture of zinc(II) carbonate (0.4 mmol), m-HO3S-Ph-PO3H2 (0.4 mmol), and bipy (0.4 mmol) in 10 mL of distilled water with an initial pH value of about 4.0 was put into a Parr Teflon-lined autoclave (23 mL) and heated at 140 °C for 4 days. Colorless plate-shaped crystals of 3 were collected in a ca. 75% yield based on Zn. Its purity was also confirmed by XRD powder diffraction (see Supporting Information). Anal.
