Synthesis of Zn3(tz)2(bdc)2⋅x(DMF) (2): A mixture of Zn(NO3)2⋅6H2O (0.0800 g, 0.27 mmol), pyrazine(0.0150 g 0.19 mmol), 1,2,3–1H‐triazole (0.0400 g, 0.58 mmol), 1,4‐benzenedicarboxylic acid (0.0500 g 0.30 mmol), N,N‐dimethylformamide (7.5 mL) in a 23 mL Teflon‐lined stainless steel vessel was heated at 120 °C for 5 days, and then cooled to room temperature. Colorless transparent crystals were thus obtained (83 % yield based on zinc).
