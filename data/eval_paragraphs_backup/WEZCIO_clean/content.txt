La2O3 (98 mg, 0.3 mmol), Co(COOCH3)2 ·  4H2O (224 mg, 0.9 mmol) and 2,2′-oxydiacetic acid (322 mg, 2.4 mmol) were mixed in 30 mL water. The mixture was placed in a Teflon-lined 45 mL stainless steel acid digestion vessel and heated at 120 °C for 45 h. The resulting solution was filtered and the filtrate allowed to stand at room temperature. After 5 days, pale red polycrystalline material containing some X-ray suitable crystals was obtained. Yield 30%. Anal. Calc. for C24H60O48Co3La2: C, 18.3; H, 4.0. Found: C, 18.6; H, 4.2%. IR peaks associated to the oda ligand appear at: 1607, 1436, and 1116 cm−1. The TGA diagram shows two weight losses: 13.5% between room temperature and 60 °C, corresponding to crystallization water loss, calc. 13.7%, and 6.6% in the interval 120–140 °C, corresponding to coordinated water loss, calc. 6.6%. Decomposition point, 280 °C.
