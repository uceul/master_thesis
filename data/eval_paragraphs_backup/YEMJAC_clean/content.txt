As a typical preparation procedure, a mixture of Dy(NO3)·nH2O (40 mg, 0.05 mmol) and H3BTC (10 mg, 0.05 mmol) was dissolved in DMF (10 mL) and ethanol (2 mL) at room temperature. Two drops of dibutylamine was added to the mixture, and then a small amount of 6 M HNO3 was added until the mixture became clear. The mixture in a 50-mL beaker was left undisturbed at 60 °C for 7 days to give colorless crystals in 76% yield (based on H3BTC). The compound was stable in air, insoluble in water and common organic solvents.
