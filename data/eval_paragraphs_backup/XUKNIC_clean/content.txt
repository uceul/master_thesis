Synthesis of 1: A mixture of Zn(NO3)2·6H2O (0.2 mmol, 0.060 g), H3L (0.1 mmol, 0.026 g), concentrated nitric acid (2 drops) and H2O (5 ml) was sealed in a small vial, which was kept at 110 °C for 80 h and then cooled to the room temperature slowly. Colorless block crystals yield in 43%. Anal. Calcd. (%) for 1 C30H20O16Zn4: C, 40.09; H, 2.23. Found (%): C, 40.05; H, 2.24.
