
A mixture containing CoCl2·6H2O (0.0476 g, 0.2 mmol), L (0.0 32 g, 0.1 mmol) and H3BTC (0.032 g, 0.15 mmol) was dissolved in 8 mL of H2O. The pH value was adjusted to about 7 with 0.1 M NaOH solution. The resulting mixture was sealed in a 25 mL Teflon lined stainless steel container and then heated at 120 °C for 6 d. After the autoclave was cooled to room temperature, two kinds of crystals with different colors, pink for 1 and purple for 2, were obtained. Approximate yields: ca. 25% for 1 and 15% for 2 (based on Co).
