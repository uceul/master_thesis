A typical synthesis involves a mixture of MgCl2·6H2O (0.2 mmol, 0.0406 g) and 2,6-naphthalenedicarboxylic acid (0.4 mmol, 0.0864g) dissolved in 10.0 mL of dimethylforamide and 2.0 mL of water and stirred for a few minutes to get homogeneous solution. The resultant solution was then placed in Teflon lined 23 mL stainless steel autoclave and was heated at 120 °C over 3 days and then cooled to room temperature at a rate of 6 °C. A white color crystalline material was collected by filtration and DMF/water mixture was used for further washings.
