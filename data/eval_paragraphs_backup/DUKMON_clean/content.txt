A mixture of Co(Ac)2·4H2O (0.0498 g, 0.1 mmol), L (0.0446 g, 0.1 mmol), pbib (0.0476 g, 0.1 mmol), NaOH (0.0160 g, 0.4 mmol), and H2O (8 mL) was placed in a 25 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel container, which was sealed and then heated at 130 °C for 72 h, followed by slow cooling to ambient temperature at a rate of 5 °C h–1. Purple crystals of 2 were obtained in a yield of 55% (based on Co). Anal. Calcd for C25H31CoN4O9 (%): C, 50.85; H, 5.29; N, 9.48. Found: C, 50.87; H, 5.28; N, 9.46.
