
A mixture of HL (0.042 g, 0.20 mmol), Zn(NO3)2·6H2O (0.030 g, 0.10 mmol), NaOH (0.008 g, 0.20 mmol), and H2O (10 mL) (pH = 8.5) was kept in a 15 mL Teflon liner autoclave at 100 °C for 3 d. After the mixture was cooled to the room temperature, colorless block crystals of complex 1 were collected with a yield of 44%. Anal. Calcd. for C24H26N8O4Zn (1): C, 51.86, H, 4.71, N, 20.16%. Found: C, 51.84, H, 4.70, N, 20.17%. IR (KBr pellet, cm−1, Fig. S1): 3445 (ms), 3101 (ms), 1556 (s), 1509 (s), 1482 (s), 1468 (s), 1384 (s), 1349 (m), 1306 (s), 1256 (s), 1138 (s), 1085 (s), 1058 (s), 964 (s), 841 (s), 808 (s), 732 (m), 655 (s).
