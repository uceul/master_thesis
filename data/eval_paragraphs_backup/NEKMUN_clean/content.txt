A mixture containing H3L2 (0.04 g, 0.13 mmol) and CoCl2·6H2O (0.15 g, 0.63 mmol) in 3 mL water and 0.2 mL of Et4NOH were sealed in a Teflon-lined autoclave and heated under autogenous pressure to 180 °C for 3 days and then allowed to cool to room temperature at the rate of 1 °C min. Block-shaped dark pink crystals of 4 were collected in ∼60% yield. The crystals were washed with water followed by acetone and air-dried. Anal. Calc. for C38H38Co2NO15.5: C, 52.25; H, 4.04; N, 1.60%. Found: C, 52.75; H, 4.16; N, 1.68%.
