Single crystals of FPYEu were synthesized by mixing 0.0604 g (∼0.39 mmol) of H2fdc, 0.1140 g of YCl3·6H2O (∼0.38 mmol), 0.0129 g of EuCl3·6H2O (∼0.035 mmol) and 0.0755 g (∼0.38 mmol) of phen with ca. 10.6 g of distilled water. The mixture was sealed in a Teflon lined autoclave and heated at 130 °C for 3 days. After cooling to room temperature, large amount of white (colorless) needle-like crystals were harvested as a pure phase by filtration, washed with distilled water (3 × 50 mL) and air dried under ambient condition. The phase was further confirmed to be FPYEu by single crystal X-ray diffraction. Yield 0.10 g, about 74% based on H2fdc.
