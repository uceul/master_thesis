Cu(NO3)2·2.5H2O (88 mg, 0.38 mmol), isophthalic acid (63 mg, 0.38 mmol), 3-pmna (78 mg, 0.38 mmol) and 0.50 mL of a 1.0 M NaOH solution were placed into 10 mL distilled H2O in a Teflon-lined acid digestion bomb. The bomb was sealed and heated in an oven at 120 °C for 24 h, and then cooled slowly to 25 °C. Blue crystals of 2 (108 mg, 55% yield based on Cu) were isolated after washing with distilled water and acetone, and drying in air. Anal. Calc. for C20H23CuN3O9 2: C, 46.83; H, 4.52; N, 8.19%.
