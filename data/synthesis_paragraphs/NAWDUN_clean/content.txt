 A mixture of Cu(NO3)2·3H2O (0.008 g, 0.032 mmol), H4L4 (0.010 g, 0.016 mmol), DMF (3 mL), ethanol (1 mL), H2O (1 mL) and HCl (1 mL, 0.1 M) was placed in a perfluoroalkoxy (PFA) reactor (7 mL) and heated at 80 °C for 4 days. After being cooled to room temperature, green crystals of (9) were collected by filtration, washed with DMF and ethanol and dried in air (70% yield based on H4L4).
