 A mixture containing CoCl2·2H2O (0.2 mmol, 47 mg), H4L (0.2 mmol, 45 mg), 1,4-bimb (0.2 mmol, 47 mg), NaOH (0.4 mmol, 16 mg) and H2O (10 mL) was placed in a 25 mL Teflon autoclave reactor and heated at 140 °C for 3 days under autogenous pressure. Then the mixture was cooled to room temperature at a rate of 5 °C h−1. Purple block-like single crystals of CP 1 were obtained in about 55% yield based on Co. Anal. Calcd for C34H52Co5N4O28 (Fw = 1259.44): C, 32.42; H, 4.16; N, 4.45%. Found: C, 32.27; H, 4.29; N, 4.59%. IR (KBr, cm−1): 3450 (s), 2940 (w), 2860 (w), 1630 (s), 1520 (m), 1420 (s), 1280 (w), 1110 (w), 719 (w), 498 (m).
