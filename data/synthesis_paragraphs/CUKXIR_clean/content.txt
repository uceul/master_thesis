The solid of MnSO4·H2O (0.016 g, 0.097 mmol) was solved in the solution of H4BTC (0.012 g, 0.048 mmol) and TTP (0.022 g, 0.100 mmol) in 4 mL of DMF and 1 mL of H2O, to which two drops of 6 mol/L HCl were added. The mixture was sealed in a vial and heated to 100 °C in a drying oven for 72 h, then cooled to room temperature. The colorless block crystals (0.017 g) of 4 were collected by filtration and dried in the air after washing with DMF and CH2Cl2 three times, respectively. Yield 82.05% (based on H4BTC). Anal. Calcd for C24H30Mn3N2O22 (Mr = 863.32): C, 33.39; H, 3.50; N, 3.24%. Found: C, 33.22; H, 3.47; N, 3.51%.
