A mixture of SrCl2 (0.159 g, 1 mmol), NaH2SIP (0.268 g, 1 mmol), and water (15 mL) was sealed into a bomb equipped with a Teflon liner, and heated at 160 Â°C for 3 days; colorless crystals of compound 1 were obtained when the sample was cooled to room temperature. The crystals were recovered by filtering, washed with distilled water, and dried in air (yield: 72% based on Sr). Elemental Anal. Calc.(%) for C8H12O11SSr: C23.77, H2.97. Found(%): C24.19, H3.49.
