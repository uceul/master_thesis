 A mixture of Co(NO3)2·6H2O (29 mg, 0.1 mmol), BPYPY (23 mg, 0.1 mmol) and trans-chdc (17.2 mg, 0.1 mmol) was dissolved in 5 mL of DMA/CH3CN/H2O (1:3:1, v/v/v). The final mixture was placed in a Parr Teflon-lined stainless steel vessel (15 mL) under autogenous pressure and heated at 95 °C for 3 days. Orange-block crystals were obtained. The yield of the reaction was ca. 67% based on BPYPY ligand. Calcd for C19H18CoN4O6: C, 49.86%; H, 3.94%; N, 12.25%. Found: C, 49.87%; H, 3.92%; N, 12.23%.
