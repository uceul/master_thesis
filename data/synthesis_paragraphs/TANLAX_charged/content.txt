The block crystal of compound 2 was prepared in the same way. 0.1066 g Tb4O7 (0.14 mmol) was dissolved into 7.0905 g (96.96 mmol) DMF and 1.5641 g (15.34 mmol) sulfuric acid under constant stirring for an hour while 1,3,5-triazine-2,4,6-triamine was not added into the solution. The resulting mixture was transferred into a 25 mL Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave and heated at 433 K for 6 days. After cooling to room temperature, the product was washed with ethanol and dried in air for one day to give the block crystals (yield 44%, with respect to Tb). The elemental analysis shows that the C, H and N contents are 9.13, 3.08 and 5.31 wt%, respectively (calculated: C, 9.01 wt%; H, 3.17 wt%; N, 5.26 wt%). IR (KBr pellet, cm−1): 3448 (b), 3206 (vs), 2781 (m), 1638 (m), 1466 (m), 1405 (w) 1112 (b), 657 (m), 603 (m). The IR spectrum of compound 2 shows the characteristic bands for dimethylamine in the region 1400–1600 cm−1. The strong bands around 1112 cm−1 can be attributed to the sulfate ion. Absorption at 603 cm−1 is due to the Tb–O vibration. A band around 3450 cm−1 can be attributed to the presence of water.
