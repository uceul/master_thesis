[(CH3)2NH2]2Zn7(µ4‐O)2(NDC)6·DMF·H2O (2): A mixture of Zn(OAc)2·2H2O (82 mg), 1‐naphthoic acid (43 mg), H2NDC (54 mg), methanol (3 mL), and DMF (4 mL) was sealed in a 25 mL, Teflon®‐lined, stainless‐steel autoclave and heated at 150 °C for 4 d. The autoclave was subsequently cooled to room temperature. Light yellow crystals were recovered by filtration, which were washed with DMF and ethanol and finally dried at ambient temperature (22.6 % yield based on H2NDC).
