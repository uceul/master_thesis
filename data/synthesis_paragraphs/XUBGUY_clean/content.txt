 TCPS (6.40 mg, 0.0125 mmol), and ZrOCl2·8H2O (16.10 mg, 0.0500 mmol) were ultrasonically dissolved in a solvent mixture of DMF (2 mL) and formic (1.2 mL) acid. The mixture was then heated at 130 °C for 2 days. After cooling to room temperature, colorless distorted-octahedron-shaped crystals were collected by filtration, and washed with DMF and dried in a 40 °C oven for 10 h (yield: 11 mg, 58% based on H4TCPS). The products are denoted as “as-synthesized”. Its purity was checked by PXRD. FTIR (KBr, ν/cm−−1): 3410 (m), 1668 (s), 1603 (m), 1534 (m), 1414 (m), 1104 (w), 775 (m), 726 (m), 653 (m), 472 (m). The sample was activated at 200 °C for 12 h before elemental analysis. Elemental analysis of Zr6O4OH4(COO)8(OH)4(H2O)4, calcd (%): C 35.21, H 2.51; Found (%): C 35.24, H 2.66.
