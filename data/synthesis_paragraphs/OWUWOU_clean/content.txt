 A mixture of CdCl2·2.5H2O (9.1 mg, 0.04 mmol), FeCl3·6H2O (5.4 mg, 0.02 mmol), NaCl (1.6 mg, 0.03 mmol), H6L (15.3 mg, 0.02 mmol), DMF (4 mL) and water (2 mL) was transferred into a Teflon-lined autoclave and heated at 100 °C for 3 days. After being cooled to room temperature at a rate of 10 °C h−1, dark red rhomboid crystals were obtained via filtration in a 28% yield.
