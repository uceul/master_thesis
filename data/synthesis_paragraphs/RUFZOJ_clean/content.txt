Cu(NO3)6·3H2O (0.3 mmol, 0.074g) was dissolved in 2 mL of DMF and then was added to the mixture of Hdmtrz (0.2 mmol, 0.021g) and H2bdc (0.2 mmol, 0.032 g) in 2 mL of DMF. The solution was sonicated for 10 min, resulting in a clear blue solution. The blue clear solution was then transferred into a Teflon-lined stainless steel vessel (15 mL), which was sealed and heated at 50 °C for 2 days. After cooling down to temperature, clear blue solution was obtained by filtration. Then, blue crystals of MAC-9 were finally obtained by slow evaporation of the blue solution at room temperature. Yield: 32% yield based on Cu(II). Anal. Calcd for C36H45Cu5N9O20: C, 34.83; H, 3.65; N, 10.15. Found: C, 35.01; H, 3.59; N, 10.25.
