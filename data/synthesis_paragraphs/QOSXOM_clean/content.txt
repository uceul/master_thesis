Zn(Ac)2·2H2O (117.8 mg, 0.5367mmol), 5-methylbenzimidazole (70.3 mg, 0.5320mmol), imidazole (44.2 mg, 0.6492mmol), (±)-2-amino-1-butanol (4.0 mL), and benzene (3.6 mL) are mixed in a Teflon-lined autoclave and stirred for 0.5 h. The autoclave was then sealed and heated up at 150 °C for 5 days, followed by cooling down to room temperature. A large amount of small colorless crystalline materials were obtained with a yield of 35.4% (based on zinc salt). The crystals were washed using ethanol three times and dried in air for other measurements. Elemental analysis of as-synthesized sample: C, 49.22; H, 4.02; N, 20.98. Elemental analysis of sample dried at 300 °C: C, 47.93; H, 3.78; N, 20.78.
