 Cd(NO3)2·4H2O (1 mmol, 308 mg), bpy (0.4 mmol, 60 mg), and THF (5 mL) were added into a solution of H4adtp (0.2 mmol, 60 mg) in H2O (5 ml) which was adjusted to the pH value at ca. 8.0 with 1 mol L−1 NaOH solution. The mixture was sealed into a 25 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave. The autoclave was heated at 120 °C for 96 hours, and then allowed to cool to 30 °C for 24 h. Colorless crystals of complex 4 were collected in 64% yield based on H4adtp. Anal. Calcd for C34H35N4O22.5Cd4 (Mr = 1309.30): C, 31.20%; H, 2.69%; N, 4.28%. Found: C, 31.48%; H, 2.83%; N, 4.37%.
