§ Synthesis of [Li4(C5H4NO)4]·x(solv): the compound can be synthesized under a wide range of experimental conditions. Typically the synthesis was by injection of 0.5 ml tert-BuOLi (1.0 M solution in hexane) to a 20 ml glass vial containing well stirred methanol (5.0 g) solution of 4-hydroxypyridine (48.2 mg, 0.5 mmol). After stirring for 15 min, the glass vial was loosely sealed and placed in a 120 °C oven for about 24 hours, when the solvent was almost evaporated out and pure colorless crystals were obtained at the bottom of the vial. The yield was above 95% based on the metal. The compound was also obtained in a 2-propanol solution at 90 °C. In addition, tert-BuLi (hexane solution) can be also used for synthesis.
