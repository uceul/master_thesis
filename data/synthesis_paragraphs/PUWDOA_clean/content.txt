Zn3O(HBTB)2(H2O)·(DMF)0.5(H2O)3 = MOF-39. H3BTB (0.030 g, 0.07 mmol), Zn(NO3)2·4H2O (0.070 g, 0.27 mmol), DMF (3 mL), C2H5OH (3 mL), and H2O (1 mL) were added respectively to a vessel, which was sealed and heated to 90 °C at a rate of 2 °C/min for 24 h and then cooled to room temperature at a rate of 1 °C/min. The solid was filtered, and the filtrate was placed in a 20-mL vial for several days. Small hexagonal crystals of the compound were mechanically separated from the resulting mixture.
