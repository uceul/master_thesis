The title compound was prepared hydrothermally from a mixture of indium nitrate (In(NO3)3 · 4.5H2O, Shanghai Reagent Plant, 99.5%), phosphoric acid (Beijing Chemical Plant, 85 wt%), Trithylenetetramine (TETA, Aldrich), hydrofluoric acid (Beijing Chemical plant, 40%) and distilled water with the molar ratio In(NO3)3 · 4.5H2O:4.0H3PO4:2.0TETA:7.0HF:555H2O. Typically, 0.35 g indium nitrate was first dispersed into 9 ml of H2O with stirring, and then 0.36 ml of H3PO4 and 0.3 ml HF were added successively with stirring to form a clear solution. Finally, 0.28 ml of TETA was added dropwise under vigorous stirring. The white gel thus formed was stirred until homogeneous. The final mixture was sealed in a Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave and heated at 180 °C for 10 days under autogenous pressure. The product (in about 70% yield based on In source) consisting of colorless block shaped crystals was separated by sonication, further washed with distilled water and dried at room temperature.
