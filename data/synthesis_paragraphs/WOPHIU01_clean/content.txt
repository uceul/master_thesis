A mixture of Zn(NO3)2·6H2O (60 mg, 0.20 mmol), H4L2 (23 mg, 0.05 mmol), 4-abpt (12 mg, 0.05 mmol), H2O (4.0 mL), and DMF (2.0 mL) was sealed in a 15 mL Teflon-lined reactor and heated at 85 °C for 72 h. Colorless crystals of 6 were obtained with 40.1% yield (18.1 mg, 0.02 mmol) based on H4L2. Anal. Calcd for C36H32N6O14Zn2: C, 47.86; H, 3.57; N, 9.30. Found: C, 46.30; H, 3.65; N, 9.17.
