 The manganese phosphite–oxalate [C4N2H12][MnII2(HPO3)2(C2O4)], I, was synthesized under hydrothermal conditions using manganese oxalate as the source of manganese. In a typical synthesis, 0.277 g of manganese oxalate was dissolved in 7 mL of deionized water. To this, 0.318 g of H3PO3 was added. Finally, 0.334 g of piperazine (PIP) was added to the mixture and homogenized for 30 min at room temperature. The final mixture with the composition 2.0 MnC2O4 : 4.0 H3PO3 : 4.0 PIP : 400 H2O was transferred into a 23 mL PTFE-lined acid-digestion bomb and heated at 150 °C for 72 h. The resulting product contained only light pink cube-like single crystals in large quantities. The crystals were filtered, washed with deionized water, and dried at ambient conditions. The yield of the product was ∼75% based on Mn. The initial pH of the reaction mixture was ∼4 and the pH value did not show any appreciable change during the hydrothermal reaction.
