A mixture of MnCl2·4H2O (0.03 g) and Mn(III)Cl-ttzpp (0.011 g) was dissolved in N,N′-diethylformamide (DEF, 2 mL) and methanol (2 mL) in a 20 mL screw-capped vial. After 6 M HCl (8 μL) had been added to the mixture, the vial was capped and placed in an oven at 75 °C for 48 h. After being cooled to room temperature, the oven was cut off, leading to the separation of perfect brownish red crystals suitable for X-ray diffraction by filtration with a yield of 0.013 g, 51% [based on Mn(III)Cl-ttzpp ligand]. It was formulated as {Mn(II)0.5[Mn(II)4Cl(Mn(III)Cl-ttzpp)2(H2O)4]}·(DEF)20·(CH3OH)18·(H2O)12 based on elemental microanalysis, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and single-crystal X-ray diffraction (XRD) studies, and the phase purity of the bulk material was independently confirmed by powder XRD (Figure S2, Supporting Information). Anal. Calcd for C214H372Cl3Mn6.5N60O54: C, 50.27; H, 7.33; N, 16.44. Found: C, 50.34; H, 7.30; N, 16.41.
