Synthesis of [Zn2(3,4-PDC)2(DMF)2(py)]n,2 (usf-51). Zn(NO3)2·6H2O (11.9 mg, 0.04 mmol) and 3,4-H2PDC (6.68 mg, 0.04 mmol) were added to a 2 mL solution of DMF, EtOH, and pyridine (py) in a 20 mL scintillation vial, heated to 85 °C for 12 h, and cooled to room temperature. The as-synthesized colorless crystals are insoluble in water and common organic solvents.
