 Gd(NO3)3 (0.045 g, 0.1 mmol), CuI (0.019 g, 0.1 mmol), KI (0.032 g, 0.2 mmol) and Hpba (0.030 g, 0.15 mmol) were placed in 5 mL of H2O/1,4-dioxane (v:v = 2:3) solution and stirred for a few hours, then transferred and sealed in a 15 mL Teflon-lined steel autoclave. The autoclave was kept in an oven at 100 °C for 4 days. After cooling to room temperature, colorless block crystals were collected by filtration, washed with 1,4-dioxane and dried in air (yield 39%). Elemental analysis calcd (%) for 4 (GdCu4I4C46H48N3O13): C 31.19, H 2.71, N 2.37; found: C 31.30, H 2.56, N 2.47. Selected IR peaks (cm−1): 2961, 2852, 1552, 1400, 1120, 769.
