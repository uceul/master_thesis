Pr(NO3)3·6H2O (0.5 mmol, 0.218 g) was dissolved in 10 mL deionized water, to which H2fum (1 mmol, 0.116 g) and glutamic acid (1 mmol, 0.147 g) were added while stirring. Finally, NaOH aqueous solution was added to adjust the pH value of the mixture to about 3.5–4. A homogeneous reaction gel was formed after stirring for 2 h, and was transferred to a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave (15 mL). The vessel was sealed and heated at 150 °C for 5 d under autogenous pressure and then cooled to room temperature. After filtered, the product was washed with ethanol and then dried under ambient conditions. Quadrate crystals of the complex 1 were collected. Elemental analysis calcd (%) for 1 in powder form: C 18.32, H 3.05, O 42.74; found: C 18.21, H 3.12, O 42.51.
