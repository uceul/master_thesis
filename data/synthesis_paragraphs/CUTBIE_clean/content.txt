 La(NO3)3·6H2O (25 mg, 0.0577 mmol) and H3TAIP (10 mg, 0.0282 mmol) were dissolved in DMF (1 mL), and then HNO3 (125 μL, 2.7 M in DMF) was added. The solution was sealed in a 20 mL vial and heated at 85 °C for 36 hours, 105 °C for 24 hours, then cooled to room temperature. Colourless block-shaped crystals were collected by filtration with a 67% yield based on H3TAIP. CHN elemental analysis (%) for 2, C49H51La2N11O17: C, 43.80; H, 3.83; N, 11.47. Found: C, 42.02; H, 4.20; N, 11.33. IR (cm−1): 1634(m), 1582(m), 1552(w), 1402(s), 1367(s), 1050(w), 852(w), 782(s), 749(m), 714(s), 422(w).
