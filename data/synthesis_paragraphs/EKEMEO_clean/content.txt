A mixture of H8L (5.0 mg, 5.65 μmol) and CuCl2·2H2O (5.0 mg, 29.32 μmol) was placed in a 20 mL scintillation vial, and a mixed solvent of N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF; 1.5 mL), ethanol (EtOH, 0.5 mL), and water (H2O; 0.1 mL) was added. After the addition of 6 M HCl (100 μL), the vial was capped and heated to 363 K for 5 days and then allowed to cool to room temperature. The small block-shaped crystals formed were filtered off and air-dried. The formula of ZJNU-80 can be best determined to be [Cu4L(H2O)4]·6DMF·2EtOH·H2O on the basis of single-crystal X-ray crystallography, TGA, and microanalysis. Elem anal.
