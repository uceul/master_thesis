‡ Synthesis of MOF 1: H3BCB (0.057 mmol, 30 mg), Tb(NO3)3·6H2O (0.110 mmol, 50 mg), DMF (2 mL), H2O (1.3 mL) and ethanol (2 mL) were placed in a 20 mL glass vial, which was sealed and heated to 80 °C for 48 h, and then cooled to room temperature. The colorless crystals formed were collected and air-dried (47% based on Tb(NO3)3·6H2O). Elemental analysis (%) calcd for [Tb(BCB)(DMF)]·(DMF)1.5(H2O)2: C, 50.20; H, 4.10; N 3.90. Found: C, 50.16; H, 4.13; N, 3.92. Elemental analysis (%) results for the water re-adsorbed 1a [Tb(BCB)(H2O)]·(DMF)0.02(H2O)2.9: C, 48.13; H, 3.08; N, 0.04. Found: C, 48.02; H, 3.10; N, 0.04.
