Zn2(ATB)(H2O)·(H2O)3(DMF)3, MOF-33. H4ATB (0.012 g, 0. 02 mmol), ZnCl2 (0.020 g, 0.15 mmol), DMF (3 mL), C2H5OH (3 mL), and H2O (2 mL) were added respectively to a vessel that was sealed and heated to 100 °C at a rate of 2 °C/min for 48 h and then cooled to room temperature at a rate of 1 °C/min. Needle-shaped colorless crystals of the product were formed and collected by filtration, yielding 0.012 g (57% yield based on H4ATB). The product gradually turned opaque in air. Anal.
