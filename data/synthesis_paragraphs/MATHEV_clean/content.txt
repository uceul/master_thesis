The cobalt phosphite–oxalate, [C4N2H12][Co4(HPO3)2(C2O4)3], I, was synthesized under hydrothermal conditions starting from cobalt (II) oxalate. In a typical synthesis, 0.285 g of CoC2O4 was dispersed in 7 mL deionized water. To this, 0.318 g of H3PO3 and 0.334 g of piperazine were added and the mixture was homogenized for 30 min at room temperature. The final mixture with the composition, 1.0CoC2O4: 2.0H3PO3: 2.0Piperazine: 200H2O, was transferred in to a 23-mL acid digestion bomb and heated at 150 °C for 96 h followed by at 180 °C for 24 h. The resulting product, contained large quantities of pink-colored cube-like single crystals only. The product was filtered under vacuum and washed with copious amount of deionized water, and dried at ambient conditions. The yield of the product was ∼80% based on Co. The initial and final pH of the reaction mixture was ∼4.
