 A mixture of Zn(NO3)2·6H2O (0.045 mmol, 13.4 mg), H6L2 (0.018 mmol, 8.7 mg), HCl (0.20 mL, 1 mol L−1) and DMF/H2O (6 mL, 5/1, v/v) was sealed in a 23 mL Teflon-lined autoclave and heated at 90 °C for 72 h. After cooling to room temperature at a speed of 10 °C h−1, colorless block crystals of C56H50N4Zn3O24 were obtained (70% yield based on Zn), washed with DMF/H2O and dried in air. Elemental analysis (wt%) found for 3: C, 49.71; H, 3.49; N, 4.24; calcd: C, 49.50; H, 3.68; N, 4.12.
