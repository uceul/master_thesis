 H3TCMTB (0.17 g, 0.30 mmol), Mg(NO3)2·6H2O (0.15 g, 0.60 mmol), N,N′-dimethylacetamide (7.5 g) and water (1.5 g) were mixed and homogenised for half an hour. The homogenous mixture was then transferred to a 25 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave and heated at 120 °C for 5 days. Needle-like colourless crystals were obtained upon cooling the reaction mixture to room temperature (cooling rate: 2 °C h−1). Yield: 0.08 g, 35% based on H3TCMTB. Mp: >250 °C.
