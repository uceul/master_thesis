 A solution of Cu(NO3)2·3H2O (19.3 mg, 0.08 mmol), H4PANAD (9.98 mg, 0.012 mmol) and 0.05 ml of concentrated HCl was mixed in a solvent of DMF/H2O (v/v = 5/1) (2 ml). The mixture was sealed in a Pyrex tube and heated to 55 °C for 5 days. The green octahedral crystals obtained were filtered and washed with DMF. The yield of the reaction based upon the weight of the solvent-free material is ∼50.6% based upon H4PANAD. Selected IR (KBr, cm−1): 2932, 1654, 1559, 1541, 1507, 1490, 1436, 1375, 1281, 1199, 1097, 903, 814, 775, 731. Anal. Calcd (Found) for activated HHU-1 [C45H25Cu2N5O12]: C, 56.56 (56.31) H, 2.83 (3.17) N, 7.33 (8.02).
