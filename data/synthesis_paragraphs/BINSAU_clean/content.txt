A mixture of H3BTN (10.0 mg, 17.1 μmol) and Mn(NO3)2·4H2O (25.0 mg, 99.6 μmol, Alfa) was dissolved into 1.5 mL of DMF in a disposable scintillation vial (20 mL). The vial was capped and heated at 100 °C for 1 week. The cubic-shaped crystals were collected in 23% yield. UTSA-28-Mn was best formulated as [Mn3(BTN)2(H2O)3]·26DMF. Selected FTIR (neat, cm–1): 1646, 1607, 1582, 1544, 1479, 1436, 1374, 1252, 1214, 1136, 1094, 1061, 964, 918, 875, 813, 778, 748, 703, 659. TGA data. Calcd weight loss for 26DMF and 3H2O: 59.4. Found: 59.1. Anal. Calcd for C156H230N26O41Mn3: C, 56.94; H, 7.05; N, 11.07. Found: C, 56.50; H, 7.21; N, 10.75.
