H3tzdc (0.017 g, 0.108 mmol), Cu(NO3)2·3H2O (0.024 g, 0.100 mmol), H2O (1 mL), CH3CN (1 mL), ETA (0.050 mL), and HNO3 (0.275 mL, 0.33 M in H2O) were added, respectively, to a 20 mL vial, which was sealed and heated to 85 °C, allowed to dwell for 12 h, then heated to 105 °C for 24 h, and then cooled to room temperature. The blue rhombododecahedral crystals were collected and air-dried, yielding 0.016 g of product (68% based on Cu(NO3)2·3H2O). The agreement between the experimental and simulated PXRD patterns indicated the phase purity of the as-synthesized product (see the Supporting Information, Figure S2). ICP and elemental analysis (wt %) for 2 Calcd: Cu, 31.5; C, 17.8; H, 1.37; N, 15.6. Found: Cu, 31.2; C, 17.2; H, 1.28; N, 14.9. FT-IR (4000–400 cm–1): 3399 (br), 3230 (br), 1673 (vs), 1395 (vs), 1342 (s), 1185 (w), 1138 (s), 1064 (w), 1010 (w), 853 (m), 784 (m), 703 (m), 553 (w), 485 (w) (Figure S3, Supporting Information).
