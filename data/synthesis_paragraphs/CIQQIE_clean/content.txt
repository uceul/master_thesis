 La(NO)3·6H2O (18 mg, 0.042 mmol), 1,3,5-tri(6-hydroxycarbonylnaphthalen-2-yl)benzene (H3BTN, 6 mg, 0.01 mmol) and benzoic acid (75 mg, 0.614 mmol) were mixed with 1.25 mL DMF in a glass container, tightly capped with a Teflon vial and heated at 120 °C for 48 h. After cooling to room temperature, brown crystals were obtained. Yield: 62% (based on the ligand).
