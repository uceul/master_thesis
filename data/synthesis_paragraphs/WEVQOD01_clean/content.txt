[Co(H2O)6][CoGd(oda)3]2⋅3 H2O (2‐Co): A mixture of Co(CH3COO)2⋅6 H2O (0.18 g, 0.75 mmol), H2oda (0.012 g, 0.75 mmol), and Gd2O3 (0.09 g, 0.25 mmol) was added to 15 mL of deionized water and the mixture stirred for 10 min. The resulting solution was heated in a 25 mL stainless steel reactor with Teflon liner at 180 °C for 3 d. After about 20 h of cooling to room temperature, violet cubic crystals of 2‐Co were obtained, isolated by filtration, and washed with water. Yield: 78 % based on Gd. Elemental analysis (%) calcd for C24H42O39Co3Gd2: C 19.94, H 2.93; found: C 20.10, H 3.00.
