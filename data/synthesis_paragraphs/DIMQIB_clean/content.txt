A mixture of Co(NO3)2·6H2O (43.8 mg, 0.15 mmol), DPNDI (21.3 mg, 0.05 mmol), and H2BDC (9.1 mg, 0.055 mmol) in DMF/CH3CN (8 mL; 3:1) solution was stirred for 1 h. The mixture was sealed in a 25 mL Teflon-lined stainless-steel reactor and heated at 80 °C for 5 days. Crude product was washed with DMF to give red block-like crystals of 1. The yield is ca. 77% based on DPNDI. Anal. Calcd for Co3C58H44N8O18: C, 52.86; H, 3.37; N, 8.50. Found: C, 52.71; H, 3.48; N, 8.32. IR (KBr, cm–1): 3430(m), 1720(s), 1680(vs), 1568(vs), 1384(s), 1242(s), 840(m), 746(m), 622(w), 522(w).
