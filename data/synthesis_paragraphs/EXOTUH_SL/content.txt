Synthesis of [Cd(tpt)(H2bpta)] ⋅ solve (2). Cd(NO3)2⋅4H2O (30.8 mg, 0.1 mmol), tpt (15.5 mg, 0.05 mmol) and H4bpta (16.5 mg,0.05 mmol) was mixed in 14 mL DMF in a vial. The vial was sealed and allowed to stand at 100 °C for 24 h. As the reaction progresses, light yellow rod shape crystal formed. Homogeneous crystals of 2 were collected, washed with DMF, and dried in air (yield: 35 mg). Anal. found: C, 50.83; H, 4.19; N, 13.52%.
