A mixture of Co(NO3)2·6H2O (0.0582 g, 0.2 mmol), H4L (0.0543 g, 0.1 mmol), 0.1 ml pyridine and DMF/DMSO (10 mL, v/v=1:1) was sealed in a Teflon-lined stainless steel vessel and heated at 120 °C for 3 days, and then cooled to room temperature. The resulting red block crystals of 1 were obtained after filtration. Yield 0.0746 g, 68.7% (based on Co(II)). Elemental Anal. Calcd. for C91H91N9O27S6Co4 (2170.81): C, 50.35; H, 4.23; N, 5.81; S, 8.86%. Anal. Found: C, 50.31; H, 4.26; N, 5.85; S, 8.83%.
