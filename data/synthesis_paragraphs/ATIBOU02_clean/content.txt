Synthesis of the compound [Mn3(HCOO)6]·DMF (1): The mixture of 50% Mn(NO3)2 water solution (0.5 mmol, 0.178 g), 4,5-Imidazoledicarboxylic acid (0.5 mmol, 0.078 g) and 5 ml DMF was sealed in a 20 ml vial and heated to 120 °C for 3 days. Cool down to room temperature and washed by methanol, colorless block crystals were obtained (73% yield). Elemental analysis (EA) for 1, C9H13Mn3NO13(508.02): Calcd. C 21.28, H 2.58, N 2.76. Found. C 21.15, H 2.63, N 2.71.
