  Method A: A mixture of CoCl2·6H2O (0.238 g, 1.0 mmol), dchtpy·4H2O (0.248 g, 0.5 mmol), oxalic acid (0.090 g, 1.0 mmol), NaOH (0.08 g, 2.0 mmol) and H2O (16 mL) was charged in a Parr Teflon-lined, stainless-steel vessel and heated at 180 °C for 72 h. Block purple-red crystals were collected and dried in air (yields: 10%). Method B: A mixture of CoCl2·6H2O (0.060 g, 0.25 mmol), 2-cyanopyrimidine (0.026 g, 0.25 mmol), dchtpy·4H2O (0.062 g, 0.125 mmol), ethanol (4 mL) and H2O (12 mL) was charged in a Parr Teflon-lined, stainless-steel vessel and heated at 160 °C for 48 h to yield block purple-red crystals (yield: 65%). A simulation of the powder X-ray diffraction pattern of 1·9H2O indicates that it is phase-pure. Anal. Calc. for C30H42Co2N4O19 1·9H2O: calcd.
