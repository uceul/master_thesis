 A mixture of Co(NO3)2·6H2O (1.0 mmol, 0.293 g), H3btc (1 mmol, 0.210 g) and Hatz (1 mmol, 0.084 g) in DMF (8 mL) and water (2 mL) was placed in a Teflon-lined stainless steel vessel (15 mL) and heated at 150 °C for 60 h, and then cooled to 100 °C at a rate of 5 °C min−1. It was kept constant at 100 °C for 8 hours, it was then cooled to room temperature at a rate of 5 °C min−1. The resulting deep purple block crystals of 1 were isolated by washing with DMF–H2O, and dried in air (yield: 83%, based on H3btc). Anal. Calcd for C24H33N15O9Co2.5: C, 35.03; H, 4.04; N, 25.53. Found: C, 34.85; H, 4.21; N, 25.62.
