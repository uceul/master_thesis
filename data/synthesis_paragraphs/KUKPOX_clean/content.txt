 A mixture of CuCl2·2H2O (0.034 g, 0.2 mmol) and Hcpt (0.020 g, 0.1 mmol) was suspended in a mixed solvent of H2O (4 mL), DMF (2 mL) and dioxane (2 mL), and then heated at 120 °C for 72 h under autogenous pressure in a 25 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel reactor. After cooling to room temperature, green block crystals were harvested. The yield was 30% for 1 (based on Hcpt). Elemental analysis calcd (%) for 1 (C46H52Cl4Cu4N14O15): C 38.45, H 3.65, N 13.65; found: C 38.18, H 3.77, N 13.32.
