 Gd(NO3)3 (0.045 g, 0.1 mmol), CuI (0.038 g, 0.2 mmol), NaI (0.030 g, 0.2 mmol) and nicotinic acid (0.049 g, 0.4 mmol) were placed in 5 mL of DMF/ethanol (v:v = 2:3) solution and stirred for a few hours, then transferred and sealed in a 20 mL Teflon-lined steel autoclave. The autoclave was kept in an oven at 100 °C for 3 days. After cooling to room temperature, yellow block crystals were collected by filtration, washed with ethanol and dried in air (yield 42%). Elemental analysis calcd (%) for 1 (GdCuIC21H20N4O7.5): C 31.65, H 2.51, N 7.03; found: C 31.39, H 2.46, N 7.17. Selected IR peaks (cm−1): 3089, 2926, 1595, 1401, 867, 761.
