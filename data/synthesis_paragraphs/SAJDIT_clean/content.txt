 A mixture of Tb(NO3)3·6H2O (22.7 mg, 0.05 mmol), H3TBOT (17.1 mg, 0.03 mmol), N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) (6 mL), N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) (1 mL), and formic acid (0.4 mL) was sealed in a Teflon-lined stainless steel vessel, which was heated at 140 °C for 3 days in an oven. After cooling to room temperature, colorless prism single crystals were produced in 62% yield (17.5 mg, based on H3TBOT). IR (cm−1): 3394 (m, br), 1656 (s), 1551 (s), 1442 (s), 1408 (s), 1238 (m), 1134 (w), 1010 (m), 827 (w), 772 (m), 685 (w). Elemental analysis (calculated/experimental, %) for [Tb(TBOT)(H2O)](H2O)4(DMF)(NMP)0.5 (C38.5H48.5N1.5O15.5Tb): C, 49.23/49.46; H, 5.20/5.32; N: 2.24/2.30.
