A solution of LiOH·H2O (4.0 mg, 0.10 mmol) in 1.0 mL of CH3OH was added to H3tatab (7.0 mg, 0.014 mmol) dissolved in 1 mL of 1,4-dioxane by a thorough sonication within 30 min. The resultant solution was sealed in a glass tube and heated at 100 °C during 3 days. Colorless needle-shaped crystals were filtered and washed with 0.5 mL of acetone (yield 6.2 mg, 0.011 mmol, 76% based on H3tatab). Anal. Calcd for C24H27LiN6O11 (%): C, 49.50; H, 4.67; N, 14.40.
