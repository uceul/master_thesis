 A mixture of ZnCl2 (5.5 mg, 0.04 mmol), FeCl3·6H2O (5.4 mg, 0.02 mmol), NaCl (1.6 mg, 0.03 mmol), H6L (15.3 mg, 0.02 mmol), DMF (3 mL) and water (1.5 mL) was transferred into a 10 mL glass vial and heated at 90 °C for 4 days. After being cooled to room temperature at a rate of 10 °C h−1, red rhomboid crystals were obtained via filtration in a 23% yield.
