[Mn4(Adi)4(DMF)2]n (3). Adipic acid (1 mmol) and MnCl2·4H2O (0.5 mmol) were dissolved in 5 mL DMF and 5 mL ethanol solution, stirred for 5 min and transferred to 23 ml Teflon-lined autoclave and heated to 90 °C for 6 h. After being maintained for 24 h, the reaction vessel was cooled to room temperature at 5 °C h−1. The colorless crystals in ca. 30% yield based on manganese were obtained and washed by ethanol. Anal. Calcd for C30H46Mn4N2O18 (3): C, 38.23; H, 4.92; N, 2.97. Found: C, 38.41; H, 4.53; N, 2.65%. IR (KBr pellet, cm−1): ν̃=2951s, 1567s, 1418s, 1390m, 1316m, 1285w, 1202w, 1141w, 912m, 738m, 709m.
