MCF‐19: A solution of Ni(NO3)2⋅7 H2O (0.087 g, 0.3 mmol) in methanol (5 mL) was added to a mixture of H2ndc (0.033 g, 0.15 mmol), Hpba (0.060 g, 0.3 mmol), and NaOH (0.028 g, 0.7 mmol) in DMA (20 mL) under stirring and heating in a 50 mL round‐bottomed flask on a water bath. The green suspension was then sealed in a 60 mL Teflon‐lined stainless steel vessel and heated to 160 °C for 3 days. Upon cooling to room temperature at a rate of 5 °C h−1, cubic green crystals were obtained (ca. 0.130 g, 65 % yield based on Ni).
