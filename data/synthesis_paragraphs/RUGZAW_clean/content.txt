A mixture of Zn(NO3)2·6H2O (0.060 g, 0.2 mmol), bpydbH2 (0.020 g, 0.05 mmol), Hdatz (0.010 g, 0.1 mmol), DMF (1.5 mL), EtOH (0.5 mL), and H2O (0.5 mL) was sealed in a 5 mL glass bottle at 70 °C for 72 h under autogenous pressure. After cooling of the mixture to room temperature, yellow block crystals suitable for X-ray diffraction analysis were obtained. The yield was 70% for 1 (based on bpydbH2). IR (KBr, cm–1): 3386 (br), 3187 (w), 1677(s), 1655(s), 1615 (s), 1384(s), 1256(m), 1097(m), 867 (m), 819 (s), 791 (s); elemental analysis calcd (%) for 1 (C98H126N20O30Zn4): C: 50.61; H: 5.46; N: 12.05; found: C 50.93, H 5.77, N 12.32.
