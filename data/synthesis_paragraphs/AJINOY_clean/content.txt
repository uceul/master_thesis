Preparation of {[Cu(cca)(4‐bpfp)]·2.5H2O}n (1): Cu(NO3)2·2.5H2O (32 mg, 0.14 mmol), 4‐bpfp (42 mg, 0.14 mmol), and 2‐carboxycinnamic acid (27 mg, 0.14 mmol) were mixed with 5 mL of distilled H2O in a 15 mL glass vial. Aqueous NaOH solution (0.5 mL, 1.0 M) was added to encourage deprotonation of the 2‐carboxycinnamic acid. The vial was sealed, heated in an oil bath at 85 °C for 24 h, and cooled slowly to 25 °C. Blue crystals of 1 (38 mg, 46 % yield based on Cu) were isolated after washing with distilled water, ethanol, and acetone and drying in air. C26H27CuN4O8.5: calcd. C 52.48; H 4.57; N 9.42 %; found C 52.31; H, 4.31; N, 9.84 %.
