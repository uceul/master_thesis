In a typical synthesis, compound 1 was prepared under hydrothermal conditions. First, a mixture of GaOOH (0.1028 g) (prepared from direct reaction of metallic gallium with distilled water at 200 °C under autogenous pressure for 3 days), H3PO3 (0.4128 g), oxalic acid (0.4683 g), and H2O (5 mL) with a molar ratio of 1:5:4:277 was stirred for 3 h in air and neutralized to pH = 2.0 with TMEDA. Then it was transferred into a 15-mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave which was heated at 165 °C for 15 days. Colorless hexagonal crystals were isolated after being washed with distilled water, filtered, and dried overnight at 50 °C (yield 46% based on Ga). The ICP and elemental analysis Calcd. (%): Ga, 30.85; P, 18.28; C, 6.40; H, 2.51; N, 2.50. Found: Ga, 30.82; P, 18.25; C, 6.36; H, 2.45; N, 2.47. IR data (KBr cm−1): 3340(m), 2800(m), 2460(m), 1608(m), 1486(m), 1100(s), 1000(s), 596(m).
