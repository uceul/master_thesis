 Zn(NO3)2·6H2O (30 mg, 0.1 mmol) and H3TCPB (25 mg, 0.05 mmol) were dissolved in a mixed solvent of DEF(3 mL) and H2O (0.5 mL). The reaction mixture was sealed in a Teflon-lined autoclave and heated under autogenous pressure at 80 °C for three days. After cooling to room temperature, colorless block-shaped crystals of 4 were obtained and washed with DEF. Yield: 82% (based on the ligand).
