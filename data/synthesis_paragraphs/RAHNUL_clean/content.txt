Preparation of [Cu3(C39H18O12)(H2O)3]⋅4 DMSO⋅9 DMF⋅9 H2O (NOTT‐113): H6LMe (0.1 g, 0.15 mmol) and Cu(NO3)2⋅3 H2O (0.29 g, 1.2 mmol) were mixed and dispersed in DMF/DMSO (1:1, 50 mL). H2O (1 mL) and HCl (2 M, 0.3 mL) were added to the mixture and mixed thoroughly. The solution was heated without stirring in an oil bath at 85 °C for 18 h, and a large amount of microcrystalline product precipitated. The blue crystalline product was separated by filtration and washed with warm DMF, and dried briefly in air. Yield: 0.24 g (80 %); elemental analysis calcd (%) for C74H129Cu3N9O37S4: C 43.23, H 6.32, N 6.39; found: C 43.62, H 4.86, N 6.39; selected IR (KBr): =2212 (w), 1660 (vs), 1576 (s), 1496 (m), 1433 (s), 1377 (s), 1303 (w), 1254 (m), 1149 (w), 1101 (m), 1064 (w), 1022 (w), 952 (w), 916 (w), 866 (w), 825 (w), 776 (m), 753 (w), 735 (m), 664 cm−1 (m).
