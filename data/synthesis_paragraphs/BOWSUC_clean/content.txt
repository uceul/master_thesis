Compound 2 was synthesized in the V2O5/H3PO3/DETA/NH4F/H2O reaction system with a molar ratio of 1/24/4/4/664. Typically, 0.046 g V2O5, 0.6 mL H3PO3, 0.11 mL DETA and 0.039 g NH4F were dissolved in 5 mL distilled water with stirring to form a homogeneous mixture with pH 1.0. After stirring for 30 min, the final reaction mixture was transferred into a sealed Teflon-lined steel autoclave and heated at 140 Â°C for 72 h. Upon cooling to room temperature, pure phase of compound 2 in the form of green block-like crystals were collected (62% yield based on V2O5) and air-dried for characterization.
