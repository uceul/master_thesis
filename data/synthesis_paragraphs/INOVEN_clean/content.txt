Gd(NO3)3·6H2O (35 mg, 0.1 mmol) in ethanol (8 ml) was added to a solution of H3ABTC (14.7 mg, 0.05 mmol) in DMF (10 ml) at room temperature in a 25 ml beaker. The mixture was stirred for 1 h and then filtered. The clear filtrate was allowed to stand for one week at 60 °C. The yellow hexahedral crystals of 1 were collected and dried in air to give the product; Yield: 45% (based on H3ABTC). mp > 300 °C.
