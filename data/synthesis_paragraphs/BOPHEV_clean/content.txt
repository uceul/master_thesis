A mixture of CdBr2 (0.104 g, 0.3 mmol), H4tpta (0.041 g, 0.1 mmol), NH3·H2O (0.1 mL/5 M, 0.5 mmol), and DMF (3 mL) was stirred, then sealed in a 15 mL Teflon-lined stainless autoclave at 130 °C for 6 days. After it was cooled to room temperature and subjected to filtration, yellow block crystals of 2 in a yield of 56.7% (based on H4tpta) were recovered. Anal. calcd (%) for C26H28CdN2O9 (2): C, 49.97; H, 4.52; N, 4.48. Found: C, 50.11; H, 4.42; N, 4.73. IR data (KBr, cm−1): 3424 (b), 2344(w), 1616(s), 1400(vs), 998(w), 832(w), 598(w).
