  4,4′-(Hexafluoroisopropylidene)diphthalic anhydride (44 mg, 0.1 mmol), 4,4′-bipyridyl (30 mg, 0.2 mmol), Ni(NO3)2·6H2O (120 mg, 0.4 mmol), and LiOH (10 mg, 0.4 mmol) were mixed in H2O (10 mL) and heated in a Parr Teflon-lined stainless steel vessel (25 mL) under autogenous pressure, which was heated to 140 °C for 40 h and subsequently cooled to room temperature at a rate of 3 °C/h. The obtained blue crystals of 1 were collected, washed with water, and dried under a reduced pressure at room temperature. Yield: 42% (based on H4hfpdpt). IR (cm−1): 3414m, 3072m, 1955w, 1605s, 1545s, 1488m, 1408s, 1364m, 1256m, 1207m, 1183s, 987s, 1066m, 986m, 858m, 810s, 725m, 632s. Anal. Calcd for C39H42F6N4O18Ni2: C, 43.13; H, 3.90; N, 5.16%. Found: C, 43.21; H, 4.10; N, 5.49%.
