 3 mL solution of Cd(ClO4)2·6H2O (0.0168 g, 0.04 mmol) in water was added into 1 mL boiling methanol solution of btpe (0.0632 g, 0.02 mmol). The mixture was sealed in a vial and heated to 90 °C for 3 days, and then cooled to room temperature at a cooling rate of 1 °C h−1. The products were filtered off, washed with methanol and dried in the air. Colorless polyhedral crystalline products suitable for X-ray crystal analysis were isolated. Yield 20% (based on Cd). Elemental analysis (%) calculated for C54H56N18O12Cl2Cd1: C, 48.67; H, 4.24; N, 18.92. Found: C, 48.09; H, 4.19; N, 18.66.
