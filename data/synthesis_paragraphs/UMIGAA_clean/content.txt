Synthesis of [Me2NH2][Zn2Co(μ3‐OH)(BTC)2(H2O)]·2H2O (FJI‐6): A mixture of Zn(ClO4)2·6H2O (0.10 mmol, 38 mg), Co(ClO4)2·6H2O (0.05 mmol, 19 mg), H3BTC (0.10 mmol, 20 mg) in DMA (5.0 mL) with additional HBF4 (0.4 mL, tetrafluoroboric acid, 40 % in water) was sealed in a 25 mL glass vial, which was heated at 100 °C for 5 d, and cooled down to room temperature. After washed by fresh DMA, the red crystals of FJI‐6 were obtained in ca. 50 % yield based on the H3BTC ligand. C18H6CoO14Zn2: calcd. C 34.41; H 3.04; N 2.01 %; found: C 33.31; H 2.94; N 1.94 %. EDS data: Zn 15.67 % and Co 7.36 % (Figure S1 and Table S2, Supporting Information).
