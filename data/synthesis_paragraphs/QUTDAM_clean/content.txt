 A mixture of Cu(NO3)2·2H2O (0.022 g, 0.12 mmol), H4L (0.016 g, 0.04 mmol) in DMF/EtOH/H2O (2:1:1 v/v/v, 15 mL) was sealed in a 25 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel container. The resulting blue-green slurry turned clear upon addition of 1 drop of aqueous HCl (37%). The solution was gradually heated at 85 °C for 5 d and then cooled down to room temperature at a rate of 5 °C h−1. The blue crystalline product was collected and washed with DMF and dried in air to give the product; yield, 68% based on Cu. Elemental analysis: calcd. for [Cu2(L)(H2O)2]·(H2O)4(C2H5OH)2(DMF)·(C28H40N2O17Cu2, %): C, 41.48; H, 5.23; N, 3.59; found: C, 41.79; H, 4.98; N, 3.48.
