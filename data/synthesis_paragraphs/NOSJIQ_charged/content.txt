A mixture of Dy2O3 (0.1895 g, 0.5 mmol), Cu(OAc)2⋅2 H2O (0.033 g, 0.3 mmol), nicotinic acid (0.2414 g, 2.0 mmol), HCOOH (27.6 mg, 0.60 mmol), and H2O (8 mL) was stirred for 12 h in air until all reagents dissolved, and then the pH of the solution was adjusted to 2 with HCl (36–38 %). Finally, this solution was sealed in a 25 mL Teflon‐lined autoclave and kept at 170 °C for seven days. Light yellow block crystals were obtained (115 mg, yield of 32.22 % based on Dy), which were washed with deionized water and dried at room temperature for 24 h. IR: =3617 (w), 3430 (s), 1602 (s), 1554 (vs), 1417 (w), 1203 (s), 1144 (w), 1013 (w), 833 (w), 757 (s), 700 (s), 664 cm−1 (s); elemental analysis calcd (%) for Dy26C171H180ClCu3N24O140: C 22.11, H 1.96, N 3.62; found: C 22.18, H 2.02, N 3.70.
