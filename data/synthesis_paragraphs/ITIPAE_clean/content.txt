A mixture of 5 mL DMF, 0.23 mL formic acid, and 89.2 mg Zn(NO3)2·6H2O (0.3 mmol) were sealed in a 15 mL Teflon lined stainless steel container and heated at 160 °C for 4 days. After the mixture was cooled to room temperature, the colorless block crystals of {[Zn3(HCOO)6]·DMF}n were obtained in 63% yield (based on Zn). Anal. Calcd for C9H13NO13Zn3 (Mr: 539.37): C, 20.04; H, 2.43; N, 2.60%. Found: C, 20.06; H, 2.42; N, 2.59%.
