H4ptptc (0.0406 g, 0.1 mmol), Eu2(SO4)3·8H2O (0.1472 g, 0.2 mmol) and conc. H2SO4 (18 M; 0.05 mL) were added to a 15-mL vial. A 1:3 (v/v) mixture of DMF and H2O (8 mL) was added to the solids. The content was sonicated for 15 min and then heated at 85 °C for 72 h. The colorless block-shaped crystals were obtained, washed with DMF, and dried in air (47% yield based on Eu). Anal.
