 Compound 3 was obtained by soft solvothermal methods: 0.1 mmol (45.6 mg) of Dy(NO3)3·6H2O was dissolved in 2 ml of DMF and added to a vial of 8 ml volume. To this solution 0.1 mmol of 5-cyano-1,3-benzenedicarboxylic acid (19.1 mg) is added in 2 ml of DMF. The reaction mixture was heated in a closed vial at 95 °C in an oven for 24 h. Pale yellow crystals were obtained. Yield: 29% based on Dy(III) ion. Elemental analysis of C42H44Dy2N8O17 (3), calcd: C 40.10, H 3.53, N 8.91; found: C 39.86, H 3.24, N 9.02.
