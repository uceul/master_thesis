 A mixture of Cd(ClO4)2·6H2O (21.0 mg, 0.05 mmol), H3L (27.6 mg, 0.1 mmol), CH3OH (2 mL) and H2O (10 mL) was stirred for 2 h in air, transferred to and sealed in a 25 mL Teflon-lined reactor, and heated in an oven at 160 °C for 72 h. The resulting colorless crystals, with a yield of 42%, were collected by filtration and washed with water and ethanol several times. The crystals of 2 lost their transparency once they were exposed to air for a while due to the loss of their partial solvent molecules to give [Cd(H3L)2](ClO4)2·6H2O. Anal. Calcd for C30H36N12O14Cl2Cd: C, 37.07; H, 3.73; N, 17.29%. Found: C, 37.22; H, 3.41; N, 17.42%. IR (KBr pellet, cm−1): 3670 (m, br), 1617 (m), 1496 (m), 1448 (m), 1190–1030 (vs, br), 994 (w), 946 (w), 872 (w), 831 (m), 763 (m), 628 (s).
