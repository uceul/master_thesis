CoHPO-CJ2 was synthesized by a solvothermal reaction of CoCl2·6H2O, H3PO3, diethylenetriamine (DETA), ethylene glycol (EG), and H2O in a molar ratio of 1.0:1.0:0.734:115:66. Typically, CoCl2·6H2O (0.238 g) was first dissolved in a mixed solvent of H2O (1 mL) and EG (7 mL), and then H3PO3 (0.164 g, 50 wt %) was added to the above reaction mixture while stirring. Finally, 0.08 mL of DETA was added to adjust the pH value of the reaction mixture to 5–6. A homogeneous reaction gel formed after stirring for 2 h was transferred to a Teflon lined stainless steel autoclave (15 mL) and then heated at 130 °C for 3 days under a static condition. The purple rod-shaped single crystals were separated from the remainder of the product by sonication, washed with distilled water, and then dried in the air. The yield is calculated as 77 wt % based on cobalt atoms. CoHPO-CJ2 could also be obtained by only using EG as the solvent but could not be produced if only using water as the solvent under similar synthesis conditions. The use of mixed solvent favors the formation of large single crystals of CoHPO-CJ2. In addition, DETA could be replaced by other organic amines, which might just play a role of adjusting the pH value. CoHPO-CJ2 could also be obtained by using methanol as the solvent with the pH value of 3, but only powder samples could be obtained.
