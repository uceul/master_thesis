Synthesis: The title compound was prepared by means of a hydrothermal reaction between Zn(OAc)2⋅2 H2O, H3PO4, [Co(en)3]Cl3 and H2O in a molar ratio of 1:3:0.5:488. Typically, Zn(OAc)2⋅2 H2O (0.25 g) was dissolved in H2O (10 mL), and then H3PO4 (85 wt %, 0.23 mL) was added and stirred. Finally, [Co(en)3]Cl3 (0.22 g) was added to the above reaction mixture. The resulting gel was stirred for one hour until it was homogeneous, and it was then sealed in a Teflon‐lined stainless steel autoclave and heated at 110 °C for 26 hours under static condition. The product, which contained orange plate‐shaped single crystals, was separated by sonication, and further washed with distilled water and then air‐dried. The X‐ray diffraction pattern of the product was in good agreement with that generated from single‐crystal structural data; this confirmed the phase purity of the as‐synthesized product.
