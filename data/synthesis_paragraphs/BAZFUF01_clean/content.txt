Synthesis of DUT‐33: Cu(NO3)2⋅3H2O (0.241 g, 1.0 mmol), H3(btb) (0.109 g, 0.25 mmol), and benzoic acid (0.299 g, 2.5 mmol) were dissolved in a mixture of DMF (5 mL), EtOH (abs., 5 mL), and pyridine (0.025 g, 0.2 mmol). The mixture was sonicated for 5 min and heated at 353 K for 24 h in a Pyrex tube. Clear light‐blue crystals of a single phase were obtained. Other than single‐crystal analysis and PXRD, no further characterization was carried out as it was not possible to obtain large amounts of the pure phase.
