Cd3L(L1)3(H2O) (1): A mixture of Cd(NO3)2·4H2O (0.05 mmol, 0.016 g), L (0.0125 mmol, 0.05 g), H2L1 (0.0375 mmol, 0.012 g), and DMF (8 mL) was heated at 150 °C in a Teflon®‐lined autoclave for 3 days; this was followed by slow cooling to room temperature. The resulting colorless block crystals were filtered off and washed with DMF (yield: ca. 78 % based on L). IR (KBr):  = 3423 (s), 1655 (m), 1607 (s), 1568 (s), 1500 (m), 1388 (s),1309 (w),1269 (w), 1065 (w), 1018 (w), 826 (m), 766 (s), 748 (m), 687 (m) cm–1. C81H50Cd3N8O13 (1680.5): calcd. C 57.84, H 2.97, N 6.66; found C 57.85, H 2.98, N 6.67.
