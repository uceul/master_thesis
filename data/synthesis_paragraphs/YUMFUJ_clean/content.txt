 La(NO3)2·6H2O (17.32 mg, 0.04 mmol) and H3TPT (4.52 mg, 0.0125 mmol) were dissolved in a mixture of DMSO (2.4 mL) and H2O (1.6 mL). The solution was sealed in a 20 mL vial and heated at 85 °C for 24 hours. When it was cooled to room temperature, the lozenge-shaped crystals were collected by filtration, and then washed with DMSO and H2O. CHSLa elemental analysis (%) for 1: calcd for C25H25S2LaO9: C 44.64, H 3.74, S 9.53, and La 20.6; found: C 43.63, H 3.87, S 10.42, and La 20.0.
