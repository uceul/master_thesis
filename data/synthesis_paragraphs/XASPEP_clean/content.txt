Synthesis of [Me2NH2][Zn3(μ3‐OH)(BTC)2DMF]·H2O (FJI‐5): H3BTC (0.10 mmol, 21 mg) and Zn(NO3)2·6H2O (0.1 mmol, 20 mg) were placed in a 23 mL glass vial with 5 mL DMF and an additional HBF4 (0.1 mL, HBF4, 40 % in water). The mixture (the pH of the solution was approximately 5.9) was heated to 100 °C for 5 d and finally cooled slowly to room temperature. Colorless crystals of FJI‐5 were washed with DMF and dried in air, obtained in ca. 52 % based on H3BTC ligand. C21H6NO14Zn3: calcd. C 36.22; H 2.91; N 3.68 %. found: C 36.6; H 2.88; N 3.73 %.
