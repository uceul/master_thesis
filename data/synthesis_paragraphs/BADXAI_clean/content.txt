Tb(NO3)3⋅6 H2O (31.0 mg, 0.07 mmol), H2L (30.0 mg, 0.10 mmol), H2O/CH3CN (4/2 mL) were mixed in a Teflon‐lined stainless steel vessel (25 mL). The mixture was heated under autogenous pressure at 120 °C for 72 h, and then cooled to RT. Colorless strip‐shaped crystals (Tb‐MOF) that were suitable for single‐crystal X‐ray analysis were obtained by filtration. The resulting crystals were washed with distilled water (yield: 89 % based on terbium) and has a formula of {[Tb(L1)1.5(H2O)]⋅3 H2O}n, which was derived from crystallographic data, elemental analysis (calcd (%): C 32.60, H 3.56, N 3.45; found: C 32.39, H 3.36, N 3.23), and TGA (Figure S3). IR (KBr): 3425 (s), 1652 (m), 1538 (s), 1461 (m), 1422 (s), 1380 (s), 1303 (m), 1269 (m), 1121 (w), 1084 (w), 1045 (w), 948 (w), 883 (w), 830 (w), 810 (w), 773 (m), 528 cm−1 (m). The deprotection process took place during the synthesis of Tb‐MOF: The acetyl group seems to be vital to this process, as replacing H2L with H2L1 does not give crystals of Tb‐MOF.
