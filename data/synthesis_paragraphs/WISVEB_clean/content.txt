Synthesis: A mixture of H4ABTC (8.95 mg, 0.025 mmol), Cd(NO3)2·4H2O (18.5 mg, 0.06 mmol), L‐glutamic acid (14.7 mg, 0.1 mmol), 0.5 mL H2O, a few drops of HNO3 (2.5 M), and 2 mL DMA was stirred for 20 min at room temperature. The solution was heated in a Teflon‐lined stainless‐steel vessel at 85 °C for 2 d, and cooled to room temperature at the rate of 5 °C·h–1. The yellow block‐shaped product 1 was collected by filtration and washed with DMA. Yield (based on the Cd salt): 36 %. The products are insoluble in water and common organic solvents. Elemental analysis for C36H55N7O15Cd2: calcd. C 41.15, H 5.28, N 9.33 %; found C 42.38, H 5.19, N 9.42 %. IR (KBr):  = 3381 (w), 2934 (w), 1640 (vs), 1569 (m), 1438 (m), 1373 (s), 1236 (m), 1116 (s), 1060 (w), 1014 (m), 963 (w), 924 (w), 847 (w), 776 (s), 726 (s), 616 (m), 513 (w) cm–1. It should be noted that the absence of the L‐glutamic acid had not lead to the isolation of any crystals.
