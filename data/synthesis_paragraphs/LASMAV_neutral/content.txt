 A mixture of Co(NO3)2·6H2O (1 mmol, 0.291 g), Hina (1 mmol, 0.121 g), hmq (2-(hydroxymethyl)-quinolin-8-ol, 0.25 mmol, 0.044 g), triethylamine (0.20 mL) and EtOH (10 mL) was sealed in a 15 mL Teflon-lined stainless-steel parr bomb at 140 °C for 96 h which was then slowly cooled to room temperature. Purple prismatic crystals of 1 were obtained in ca. 5% yield based on Hina. Elemental analyses for 1 (C102H162Co12N16O76): calcd (%): C, 34.65; H, 4.62; N, 6.34. found (%): C, 34.04; H, 4.57; N, 6.62. IR for 1 (KBr, cm−1): 3418(s), 1618(s), 1549(s), 1420(vs), 1317(w), 1223(w), 1134(w), 1052(w), 1019(w), 944(w), 880(w), 775(m), 693(m), 568(w), 439(w).
