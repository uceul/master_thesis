Compound 2: [Zn(BDC‐OH)(TED)0.5]⋅1.5DMF⋅0.3H2O (2) was prepared by a solvothermal reaction of [Zn(NO3)]⋅6H2O (0.089 g, 0.3 mmol), BDC‐OH (0.055 g, 0.3 mmol), and TED (0.022 g, 0.2 mmol) in DMF (10 mL). The mixture was sealed in a Parr reaction vessel and heated at 373 K for 2 d. After naturally cooling to room temperature, the colorless rod‐like single crystals of 2 (0.080 g, 64 % yield based on metal) were isolated by filtration and washed with DMF.
