We sought to synthesize I in pure form by employing another route starting with a cobalt(II) tris amine complex. The amine complex was prepared using the standard inorganic synthesis procedures16 starting from CoCl2·6H2O and ethylenediamine (en) in water at room temperature. The clear solution thus formed was allowed to undergo areal oxidation over a period of 48 h. The purity of the amine complex was checked using IR, TGA studies and used without further purification. In a typical synthesis, 0.416 g of Co(en)3Cl3·2H2O was dissolved in 3 mL of deionized water and 0.15 mL of aq H3PO4 (85 wt %) was added to it under continuous stirring. H2C2O4·2H2O (0.138 g) was added to the above, and the mixture was stirred until homogeneous. The final composition of the mixture was Co(en)3Cl3·2H2O: 2H3PO4: H2C2O4: 150H2O. The final mixture with a pH of 2, was transferred to a 7 mL Parr-type PTFE-lined stainless steel pressure vessel and heated at 165 °C for 70 h under autogenous pressure. The resulting product was found to be a mixture and contained large quantities of crystals of I admixed with another reported cobalt phosphate by Chen et al.11 and other as yet unidentified phases which are currently being investigated. The crystals were filtered and washed thoroughly with copious quantity of deionized water. The crystals were dried at ambient atmosphere at room temperature. An EDAX analysis gave the Co:P as 51.8:48.2 (Calcd. 50:50) for I and 58.6:41.4 (Calcd. 57.2:42.8) and II, respectively.
