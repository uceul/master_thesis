 A 35 mL 19/22 flask was charged with 0.5 mmol (0.136 g) polymeric nickel cyanide hydrate Ni[Ni(CN)4]n(H2O)3 and made to dissolve through the sequential addition of 5 mL H2O, 5 mL concentrated ammonium hydroxide solution (∼28%), and 5 mL dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) with stirring. (Caution: do not mix concentrated ammonium hydroxide and DMSO directly as rapid outgassing of NH3 can occur.) A solution of 0.75 mmol (0.136 g) of 1,2-bis(4-pyridyl)ethylene “bpene” in 10 mL DMSO was then added to the resulting solution. A six inch air-cooled condenser was added and the flask was transferred to an oil bath preheated to 70 °C. The temperature of the oil bath was ramped to 90 °C over approximately 30 minutes after which the stirring was stopped and the reaction left at 90 °C undisturbed for 24 h to 48 h. The dissolved NH3 bubbled out of the solution rapidly during the initial hour with the simultaneous formation of a small amount of finely powdered precipitate, then slowed significantly while a crystalline product formed over the next several hours. After completion, the reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature and the resulting violet crystals were isolated by pipetting off the majority of a fine particle suspension of impurities while being careful to leave the crystals wetted within the reaction mixture. The impurities were removed by filtration and the filtrate returned to the flask. The pipetting and filtration cycle was repeated until the powdered impurities were removed. The light violet crystals were kept stored in the cleaned reaction mixture in a capped vial at room temperature until the X-ray diffraction measurements were taken.
