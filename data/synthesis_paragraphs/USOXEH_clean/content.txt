A mixture of Zn(OAc)2·2H2O (0.052 g, 0.24 mmol) and [Cu(HIm)4](NO3)2 (0.092 g, 0.20 mmol) was dissolved using a solvent mixture of DMF/water/MeOH (2/1/1, v/v). The pH of the solution mixture was adjusted to ca. 5.4 by addition of acetic acid. The solution mixture was then introduced to a borosilicate glass tube. The tube was flash frozen at 77 K using a liquid N2 bath, evacuated for 15 min to remove oxygen, and then flame-sealed to maintain a oxygen-free environment inside the tube during the reaction process. After the sealed reaction tube was heated at 85 °C for 4 d, truncated colorless crystals were obtained. The crystals were subsequently collected and washed with DMF, water, and MeOH (3 × 2 mL, each) before SXRD analysis. For the activation procedure, as-synthesized ZIF-202 was washed five times with DMF per day (5 mL each), exchanged nine times with anhydrous MeOH (5 mL each) over the course of 3 d, and then activated at 80 °C under reduced pressure (1 mTorr) for 24 h. Yield: 65% based on copper imidazole complex. EA of activated sample: Calcd for Cu2ZnC12H12N8 = Cu2Zn(Im)4: C, 31.28; H, 2.63; N, 24.32%. Found: C, 31.29; H, 2.54; N, 24.10%. ICP-OES of activated sample (2.0 mg of ZIF-202 in 10 mL of HNO3 (1.68 M)): Cu, 4.531 ppm; Zn, 2.338 ppm.
