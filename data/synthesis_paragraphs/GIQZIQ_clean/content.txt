[Mg3(ndc)3(dmf)2(CH3OH)(H2O)](dmf) (2): A mixture of Mg(NO3)2·6H2O (0.52 g, 2.0 mmol) and 2,6‐naphthalenedicarboxylic acid (0.32 g, 1.4 mmol) in dmf (20 mL) and CH3OH (20 mL) was filled into a 250‐mL Teflon liner. The mixture was heated in an autoclave at 383 K for 24 h, then cooled to room temperature at a rate of 0.05 K min–1. The resulting colourless crystals were collected, washed with methanol and dried under argon to give 2. Yield: 0.36 g (73.5 %). Mg3C46H45N3O17 (984.78): calcd. C 56.10, H 4.61, N 4.27; found C 55.46, H 4.62, N 4.22.
