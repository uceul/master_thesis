A mixture of Co(OAc)2·4H2O (0.3 mmol), tipb (0.1 mmol), H2obba (0.3 mmol), and two drops of pyridine in 5 mL DMF was sealed in a 16 mL Teflon lined autoclave and heated at 120 °C for 5 days. The autoclave was then cooled to room temperature at a rate of 2 °C/h. The red crystalline product obtained was separated by filtration and washed with DMF. Yield: 35% (based on tipb). FT-IR (KBr pellets, cm–1): 3121, 1669, 1607, 1519, 1396, 1303, 1237, 1159, 1102, 1060, 963, 929, 879, 830, 781, 735, 659, 543.
