A solid mixture of H3TAPB (22.0 mg, 0.033 mmol) and Cu(NO3)2·2.5H2O (76.7 mg, 0.33 mmol) was dissolved in a mixture of DMF/NMP/pyridine (5.0/5.0/0.4 mL) in a 20 mL glass vial. The clear reaction solution was heated in an isotherm oven at 85 °C for 48 h resulting in blue hexahedron crystals, which were isolated by washing with a mixture of DMF and NMP (3 × 10 mL) and dried in air. Yield: 19.3 mg, 77% based on H3TAPB. Elemental microanalysis for evacuated MOF-388, Cu3(TAPB)2(H2O)3 ≡ C84H54N6O15Cu3, calculated (%): C, 63.94; H, 3.45; N, 5.33.
