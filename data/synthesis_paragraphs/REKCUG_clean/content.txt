The title compound was hydrothermally prepared from a mixture of ZnO, H3PO3, 3-dimethylamino-1-propylamine, and distilled water with a molar composition of 15:30:8:1110. Typically, 1.231 g H3PO3 was first dissolved in 10 mL H2O, then 0.601 g of ZnO was added with stirring. Finally, 0.50 mL of 3-dimethylamino-1-propylamine (98% Fluka) was added dropwise to the above reaction mixture. The mixture was sealed in a 23 mL capacity of Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave under autogenous pressure, and heated at 160 Â°C for 120 h. After cooling colourless crystals for single crystal X-ray diffraction (XRD) were obtained. The yield was 85%, based on Zn.
