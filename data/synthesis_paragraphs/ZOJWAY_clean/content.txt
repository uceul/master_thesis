 A mixture of the organic linker H4L (8.0 mg, 0.015 mmol) and Cu(NO3)2·2.5H2O (20.0 mg, 0.086 mmol) was dissolved in 3.5 mL of mixed solvent (DMF/H2O, 3 mL/0.5 mL) in a screw-capped vial (20 mL), to which three drops of HBF4 were added. The vial was capped and heated in an oven at 60 °C for 24 h. Green block crystals were obtained by filtration and washed with DMF several times to give UTSA-80 at a yield of 65%. UTSA-80 has a best formula of [Cu2L(H2O)2]·4DMF·3H2O, which was obtained based on single-crystal X-ray structural determination, elemental analysis and TGA. Anal. calculated for C44H52N4O17Cu2: C, 51.01; H, 5.06; N, 5.41%. Anal. found: C, 49.98; H, 5.14; N, 5.48%. TGA data for loss of 4DMF and 5H2O: calculated, 37.00%; found, 37.75%. IR (neat, cm−1): 1629, 1564, 1427, 1366, 1248, 1099, 766, 717, 656.
