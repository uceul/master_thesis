 A mixture of In(NO3)3·4.5H2O (0.0382 g, 0.1 mmol) and H8L (0.0158 g, 0.02 mmol) in 6 mL DMF and three drops of HCl (6 mol L−1) was sealed in a Teflon-linear autoclave (25 mL), heated at 160 °C for 1 day, and then slowly cooled down to room temperature. Colorless block single crystals of 1 were collected by filtration, washed with DMF and CH2Cl2 and air-dried. Yield 60% (based on H8L).
