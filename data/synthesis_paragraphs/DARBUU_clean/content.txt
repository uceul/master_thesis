Preparation of [Me4N]2[Cu4(CN)5Cl] (2). A mixture of CuCN (81 mg, 0.9 mmol) and Me4NCl (99 mg, 0.9 mmol) in 10 mL of dry and distilled THF was sealed into a 25 mL poly(tetrafluoroethylene)-lined stainless steel containers under autogenous pressure and then heated at 120 °C for 3 days and cooled to 30 °C at 2 °C h-1. Large orange crystals of 2 were obtained in ca. 75% yield (based on copper). Anal. Calcd for for 2 (C13H24N7ClCu4):  C, 27.49; H, 4.62; N, 17.26. Found:  C, 27.60; H, 4.65; N, 17.18. FT-IR (KBr, cm-1):  3472 w, 3019 m, 2959 w, 2784 w, 2577 w, 2465 w, 2117 m, 2079 m, 1487 vs, 1404 s, 1286 w, 948 vs, 455 w. FT-R (KBr, cm-1):  ν(CN) 2115(m), 2087(m).
