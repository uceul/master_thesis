Blue columnar crystals of 1 were obtained from a hydrothermal self-assembly of Ni(CH3COO)2·4H2O (10 mg, 0.04 mmol), N2H4·H2O (0.1 mL) and H2C2O4 (3 mg, 0.02 mmol) in a 10 mL aqueous solution (pH = 4, adjusted by H2C2O4) at 170 °C for 3 days. Yield: ca. 15% based on Ni(II). Anal. Calc. C2H6N2O5Ni (1): C 12.21, H 3.07, N 14.24. Found: C 12.63, H 2.81, N 14.45%. IR (cm−1): 3307 s, 3258 m, 1643 s, 1383 w,1341 m, 1204 w, 1170 m, 988 w, 802 m, 674 w, 618 w.
