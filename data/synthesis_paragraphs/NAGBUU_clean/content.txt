Synthesis of 1: A mixture containing 4-cyanopyridine (15.6 mg, 0.15 mmol), NaN3 (10.0 mg, 0.15 mmol), H2nip (21.0 mg, 0.1 mmol) and CoCl2·2H2O (47.6 mg, 0.2 mmol) was dissolved in water (10 mL) and stirred briefly. And the initial pH of the mixture was adjusted to 6 by slow addition of an appropriate amount of triethylamine. The mixture was then sealed in a parr Teflon-lined stainless steel vessel (23 mL) and heated to 180 °C for 72 h under autogenous pressure. After the mixture was cooled to room temperature at a rate of 3 °C·h− 1, pink block-shaped crystals were generated directly. Yield: 53% based on CoII salt.
