 A mixture of MoO3 (0.086 g, 0.60 mmol), 3-abpt (0.047 g, 0.20 mmol), Co(NO3)2·6H2O (0.029 g, 0.10 mmol) and water (8 mL) was sealed in a 15 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel vessel, which was heated at 140 °C for 72 h. The reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature at a rate of 10 °C h−1. Pink cubic crystals of 5 were collected in 50% yield based on 3-abpt.
