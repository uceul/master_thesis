A mixture of 5.0 mg of H4L (0.0065 mmol) and 10 mg of Cu(NO3)2·2.5H2O (0.0215 mmol) was dissolved in 2.0 mL of DMA in a screw-capped vial. After 0.30 mL of H2O and 30 μL of HNO3 (65%, aq.) were added into the mixed solution, the vial was sealed and moved to a precise oven at 80 °C for 1 day. The resulting blue rodlike crystals were washed with DMA three times to remove the unreacted organic link and metal salt to give the fresh ZJU-31 sample.
