A mixture of Bi(NO3)3·5H2O (0.25 g, 0.52 mmol), H2C2O4·2H2O (0.63 g, 5.00 mmol), triethylamine (0.10 mL) and distilled water (3.50 mL) was stirred to homogeneity for 10 min in air. The mixture was loaded into a 15 mL Teflon-lined steel autoclave and heated at 100 °C for 2 days, and then cooled to room temperature. The colorless block crystals of 2 were collected. The product is stable in air and insoluble in water. Yield: 0.06 g (ca. 12% based on bismuth). Bi3C16NO20H16 (1169.24): calcd. C 16.44, H 1.38, N 1.20; found C 16.53, H 1.45, N1.12. IR (KBr): υ=3396 cm−1 (m), 3168 (w), 1619 (s), 1439 (m), 1298 (w), 789 (w), 476 (w).
