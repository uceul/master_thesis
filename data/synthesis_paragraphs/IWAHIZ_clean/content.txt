[tmpip][Al6(PO4)6(HPO4)]·(H2O) (3) A mixture of Al(OH)3 (0.0796 g, 1 mmol), H3PO4 (0.33 mL, 5 mmol), 1-methylpiperazine (0.27 mL, 2.5 mmol), methanol (3.0 mL, 75 mmol) and H2O (2.0 mL, 111 mmol) was sealed in a Teflon-lined autoclave and heated at 175 °C for 6 days. After cooling to room temperature, filtration and washing with distilled water, colorless crystals of 3 were obtained and dried in air (78.2% yield based on Al). Anal.
