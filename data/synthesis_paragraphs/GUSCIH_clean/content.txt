A mixture of Gd(NO3)3·6H2O (0.3 mmol, 0.14 g), CoCl2·6H2O (0.3 mmol, 0.07 g), pyridine-2,5-dicarboxylic acid (0.2 mmol, 0.03 g), K2(C2O4)·H2O (0.1 mmol, 0.02 g), NaOH (0.2 mmol, 0.01 g) and 10 mL deionized water were sealed into a 23 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave. After heating for three days at 443 K and then cooling to room-temperature in air, red block-like crystals were isolated in ∼45% yield (based on Gd). Anal. Calc. for C46H42Co2Gd4N6O45: C, 25.75; H, 1.97; N, 3.92. Found: C, 25.70; H, 2.01; N, 3.95%. IR (KBr, cm−1): 3373(s), 1380(s), 1312 (m), 1290(w), 1145(w), 1124(w), 1010(m), 784(m), 554(m).
