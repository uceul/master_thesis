In a typical synthesis, 0.14 g (2 mmol) of TAZ, 0.35 g (2 mmol) of zinc fluoride tetrahydrate and 10 mL of water were placed in a 23 mL Teflon-lined autoclave. The resulting mixture was stirred for 5 min prior to sealing the autoclave. The autoclave was then placed in a programmable furnace and heated to 160 °C at 1 °C/min and held at that temperature for 3 days. The mixture was then cooled to 60 °C at 0.1 °C/min and kept at 60 °C for 1 day before the furnace was shut off. Colorless needle-shaped crystals formed. Yield: 68%.
