 A mixture of Cd(NO3)2·4H2O (0.02 mmol, 6.1 mg), H5L1 (0.01 mmol, 4.5 mg), HCl (0.15 mL, 1 mol L−1) and DMF/H2O (6 mL, 5/1, v/v) was sealed in a 23 mL Teflon-lined autoclave and heated at 100 °C for 72 h. After cooling to room temperature at a speed of 10 °C h−1, colorless block crystals of C29H23N2Cd2O12 were obtained (69% yield based on Cd), washed with DMF/H2O and dried in air. Elemental analysis (wt%) found for 2: C, 42.79; H, 2.70; N, 3.51; calcd: C, 42.68; H, 2.82; N, 3.43.
