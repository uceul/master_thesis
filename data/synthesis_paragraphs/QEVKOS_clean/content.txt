{[WS4Cu4(NCS)2(bix)3]·CH3CN}n(2). Method A. A mixture of [Et4N]2[WS4] (0.11 mmol, 62.99 mg), CuNCS (0.33 mmol, 40.14 mg), and bix (0.17 mmol, 40.51 mg) was placed in a glass tube, and 2 mL of CH3CN was added. The tube was sealed after evacuation and heated to 120 °C for 1 day. Upon slow cooling of the solution to room temperature over 2 days, red crystals of 2 were obtained in 25% yield (based on CuNCS). Anal. Calcd for C46H45Cu4N15S6W:  C, 38.38; H, 3.13; N, 14.60. Found:  C, 37.96; H, 3.17; N, 14.78.
