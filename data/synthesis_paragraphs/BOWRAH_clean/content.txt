(C3H12N2)FeIII 6(H2O)4[B4P8O32(OH)8] was prepared under mild hydrothermal conditions at 443 K. A mixture of 0.811 g FeCl3·6H2O (Alfa, 99.8%), 1.484 g H3BO3 (Alfa, 99.9%), 0.822 g C3H10N2 (1,3-diaminopropane, DAP, Aldrich, 99%) and 1.26 g H3PO4 (85%, Merck, p.a.) (molar ratio of 3:24:11:11), together with 7.5 ml H2O was stirred at 333 K for 2 h. Meanwhile 0.8 ml 37% HCl was added to adjust the pH value to 1.0. The clear colourless solution was transferred into a Teflon autoclave (V=10 ml, degree of filling 60–70%) and treated at 443 K for eight days. Colourless prismatic crystals of (C3H12N2)FeIII 6(H2O)4[B4P8O32(OH)8] up to 0.2 mm in length were separated from the mother liquor by vacuum filtration followed by washing several times with deionized water and drying at 333 K in air. During our study on the preparation of the title compound, we found that the H3BO3 content in the starting mixture has a large effect on the final product. By keeping all the other parameters constant, the use of only half amount of H3BO3 (0.742 g) leads to lower yield of the title phase and an additional unidentified iron phosphate. By increasing the boron content to 2.968 g H3BO3, the crystal size of the title compound increases and some additional small amounts of an unknown white fine powder is observed. By this, the amount of boric acid in the starting mixture appears to be the most important factor to obtain a pure reaction product. The phase purity of samples applied for further properties investigations was checked by elemental analyses and powder X-ray diffraction.
