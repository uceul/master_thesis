A mixture of Zn(NO3)2·4H2O (60 mg) and H3L (45 mg) were placed in a mixed solution of DMF (10 mL) and CH3OH (0.3 mL), with several glass slides in a screw-capped vial, and placed in a 90 °C oven for 2 days. The crystals grew on the glass slides and the slides with crystals were taken out of the solution and thoroughly washed with DMF and EtOH before other experiments.
