 A mixture of CuCl2·2H2O (15.0 mg, 88.0 μmol) and the organic linker H4L3 (5.0 mg, 9.8 μmol) was dispersed in a mixed solvent consisting of DMF (1.5 mL), methanol (0.5 mL) and water (0.08 mL) in a 20 mL glass vial. After the addition of 80 μL 6 M HCl, the vial was capped and heated at 353 K for 36 h. Rhombus-shaped blue crystals were collected by filtration in a yield of 44% based on the organic ligand H4L3. Selected FTIR (kBr, cm−1): 1655, 1560, 1381, 1103, 1047, 775, 731; anal. for C28H26Cu2N4O12Se, calcd: C, 41.18%, H, 3.21%, N, 6.86%; found: C, 41.22%, H, 3.15%, N, 6.79%.
