 A solution of H2mip (0.2 mmol) in 6 mL H2O was adjusted to pH 6 with dilute NaOH solution. Then btpm (0.1 mmol) in 5 mL MeOH and Cd(NO3)2·4H2O (0.2 mmol) in 5 mL H2O were added with stirring. The mixture was added to a 25 mL Teflon-lined stainless autoclave and this was sealed and heated to 110 °C for 3 days and then cooled to room temperature to give the pale yellow crystals 2 in 47% yield.
