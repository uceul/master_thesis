Syntheses of two complexes [Zn(cpt)2]n (1) and [Cd(cpt)2 · 2DMF]n (2) [Hcpt = 1-(4-carboxy- phenyl)-1,2,4-triazole] are as follows: A mixture of MIICl2 (0.25 mmol) (M = Zn(1), Cd(2)), ligand Hcpt (0.5 mmol), and DMF (10 mL) was heated at room temperature to 150 °C for three days in a 25 mL Teflonlined stainless-steel autoclave and was then cooled to room temperature at 5 °C/h− 1 to obtain corresponding colorless block crystals 1–2 (yield: 53% for 1 and 49% for 2 based on MII).
