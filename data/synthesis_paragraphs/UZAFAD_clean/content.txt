A mixture of NiCO3 (11.9 mg, 0.10 mmol), H2male (11.6 mg, 0.10 mmol), L (16.8 mg, 0.05 mmol), and water (10 mL) was placed in a Teflon reactor (15 mL) and heated at 170 °C for 3 days. After the mixture had been cooled to room temperature at a rate of 10 °C h−1, blue crystals of 1 were obtained with a yield of 81% (based on NiCO3). Anal. Calc. for C23H35N8Ni1.5O12 (Mr = 703.61): C, 39.26; H, 5.01; N, 15.93. Found: C, 39.94; H, 5.17; N, 16.12%. IR (cm−1): 3639(s), 3420(s), 3141(w), 3099(w), 2955(m), 1630(s), 1517(s), 1453(s), 1369(w), 1319(w), 1287(m), 1240(s), 1198(w), 1110(s), 1088(w), 1026(m), 977(m), 877(w), 831(m), 750(m), 664(m), 628(m), 526(m). When the H2male was replaced by H2fum, the crystals of compound 1 also can be obtained.
