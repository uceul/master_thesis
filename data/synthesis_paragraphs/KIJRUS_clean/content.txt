H4L was synthesized according to the reference procedure.(13) A mixture of H4L (5.00 mg, 0.0079 mmol) and CuCl2·2H2O (10.00 mg, 0.0587 mmol) was dissolved in DMF/H2O (2.4 mL, 5:1, v/v) in a screw-capped vial. After concentrated hydrochloric acid (10 μL) (37.5%, aq) was added to the mixture, the vial was capped and placed in an oven at 60 °C for 48 h. The resulting green block single crystals were washed with DMF several times to give ZJU-30. Elemental anal.
