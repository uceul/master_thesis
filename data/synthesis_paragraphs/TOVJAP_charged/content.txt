Synthesis of [H3N(CH2)2NH3]2 [H3N(CH2)2NH2] [FeIII(H2O)2(VIVO)8(OH)4(HPO4)4(PO4)4]·4H2O (2). The synthesis was similar to the above described for solid 1. The hydrothermal reaction of V metal (0.0254 g), V2O5 (0.1821 g), Fe(NO3)3·9H2O (0.1480 g), ethylenediamine (0.26 mL), H3PO4 85% (0.25 mL), acetic acid (0.16 mL), and water (9.52 mL) in the optimized molar ratio 0.5:1:0.36:3.37:3.67:2.79:528 (pHi = 3.6) for 48 h at 200 °C and autogeneous pressure allowed us to obtain a gray-blue polycrystalline monophasic solid with a yield of 85% (based on vanadium). Compound 2 was separated by filtration (pHf = 4.0), washed with water and acetone, and air-dried (Anal. Found:  C, 4.17%; N, 4.92%; H, 2.83%; Fe, 3.29%; V, 23.73%; P, 14.50%. Calcd:  C, 4.20%; N, 4.90%; H, 2.88%; Fe, 3.25%; V, 23.74%; P, 14.43%). Several small and well-formed blue crystals of 2 were obtained together with the polycrystalline sample. One crystal of 2, suitable for single crystal diffraction techniques, was selected for the structural study. On the basis of X-ray powder diffraction analysis, both the single crystal and the gray-blue powder correspond to the same solid. The presence of Fe in the final solid was initially confirmed by X-ray fluorescence analysis. Moreover, microprobe analyses, both on powdered samples and selected single crystals, confirm the presence of Fe and the proposed formulation. Finally, in order to determine in a more conclusive way the Fe/V ratio, chemical analyses were carried out by means of atomic absorption spectrometry.
