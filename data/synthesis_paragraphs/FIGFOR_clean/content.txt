Hydrothermal reactions were carried out in home-made Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclaves with 8 mL capacity. 1 was prepared from starting mixtures of approximate molar compositions ZnCl2:H3BO3:H3PO4:TETA:H2O = 1:1:2:0.75:7. A typical experiment was as follows: 2.517 g (85%) H3PO4, 1.000 g H2O, 1.469 g ZnCl2 and 0.654 g H3BO3 were combined. To this, 1.177 g TETA was added dropwise under stirring. Heat evolved and a white solid separated. The mixture (pH 1) was boiled (allowing water to evaporate) until a viscous homogeneous clear gel resulted. The hot gel was transferred into an autoclave (degree of filling 50%) and heated at 160 °C under static conditions and autogeneous pressure for three days. No change of pH was measured after hydrothermal treatment. The solid product was recovered by filtration, washed with water and ethanol and dried in air at 70 °C. Tiny colourless crystals of pure 1 were obtained with a yield of 30% (based on Zn).
