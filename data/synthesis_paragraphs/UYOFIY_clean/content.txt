Synthesis of 1: A mixture of Tb(NO3)3⋅6H2O (45.3 mg, 0.10 mmol), H3IDC (15.6 mg, 0.10 mmol), Et3N (0.1 mL) and EtOH/H2O (1:1, 4 mL) was sealed in a 10 mL Teflon-lined stainless-steel reactor and then heated to 110 °C for 48 h under autogenous pressure. After the sample was slowly cooled to room temperature at a rate of 5 °C/h, colorless block crystals of 1 were collected after washing with water and ethanol (yield: 62%). Anal. Calcd. for C15H10N6O21Tb2: C, 19.41, H, 1.09, N, 9.05; Found: C, 19.32, H, 1.16, N, 9.08%. IR (KBr, ν/cm−1): 3230 s, 2926w, 2853w, 2346w, 1578 s, 1560 s, 1495 m, 1459w, 1384 s, 1244 m, 1145w, 1090 m, 1012w, 969w, 860w, 804 s, 731w, 648 m, 529 m, 459w. Synthesis of 2: The synthesis of 2 was similar to the above description as 1 except that Tb(NO3)3⋅6H2O was replaced by Eu(NO3)3⋅6H2O (44.6 mg, 0.10 mmol). After washing with water and ethanol, colorless block crystals of 2 were obtained with a yield of 43%. IR (KBr, ν/cm−1): 3293 s, 2367w, 1579 s, 1496 s, 1457w, 1388 s, 1244 s, 1138w, 1090 m, 1041w, 971 m, 861w, 807 s, 651 m, 604w, 534 m, 458w.
