A mixture containing H4L (20 mg, 0.05 mmol), L2 (8.5 mg, 0.05 mmol), and Cd(NO3)2·4H2O (30 mg, 0.1 mmol) in DMF (2 mL) and ethanol (1 mL) was heated at 100 °C under autogenous pressure in a Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave for 72 h. When cooled to room temperature at the rate of 5 °C h–1 compound 2 was obtained as colorless block-shaped crystals in ∼40% yield. Anal. Calcd for C98H118N17O34Cd4: C, 46.57; H, 4.71; N, 9.42%. Found: C, 46.40 ; H, 4.80 N, 10.05. FT-IR (KBr pellets, cm–1): 3441br, 2937w, 1653 s, 1391w, 1102 m, 706 s.
