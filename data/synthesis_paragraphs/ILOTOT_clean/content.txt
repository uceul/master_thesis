A mixture of Co(NO3)2·3H2O (0.025 g, 0.11 mmol), 1,3-bis(4-carboxy-phenoxy)propane (H2bcp) (0.032 g, 0.1 mmol), CH3OH (2 mL), CH3CN (1 mL), and NaOH (0.5 M, 0.4 mL) and deionized water (8 mL) was stirred for 30 min in the air, then transferred and sealed in a 25 mL Teflon reactor, which was heated at 150 °C for 72 h. The solution was then cooled to room temperature at a rate of 5 °C h−1, to yield a very fine pink crystalline product (1) in 40% yield (based on Co). C34H33Co2O15 (799.46) (1) Anal. Calcd: C, 51.18; H, 4.16. Found: C, 52.33; H, 3.88. IR (cm−1): 3419vs, 3022m, 1554s, 1405s, 1249 m, 781 m.
