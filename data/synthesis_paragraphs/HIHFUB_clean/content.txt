 A mixture of NdCl3·6H2O (0.0355 g, 0.1 mmol) and H4L (0.0255 g, 0.05 mmol) in 2 mL of H2O, 4 mL of DMF and two drops of HCl (6 mol L−1) was sealed in an autoclave equipped with a Teflon liner (25 mL), heated at 140 °C for 3 days, and then cooled to room temperature. Purple rod single crystals of 1 were collected in a ca. 35% yield based on H4L. The phase purity was confirmed by powder X-ray diffraction (Fig. S1 in ESI).
