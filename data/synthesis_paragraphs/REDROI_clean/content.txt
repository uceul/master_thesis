Synthesis of Zn5(OH)4(BDC)3 · 2DMF (1): Zn(NO3)2 · 6H2O (0.445 g, 1.5 mmol) and H2BDC(0.083 g, 0.5 mmol) were dissolved in 10 mL DMF, into which 3 drops of 35% H2O2 was added. The colorless solution was kept at 80 °C. Many rod-like crystals were collected after one month in a yield of 0.155-g (90% yield, based on H2BDC). IR(KBr, cm−1): 3612(m), 3412(m), 2930(m), 2843(m), 2507(w), 1963(w), 1662(s), 1608(s), 1501(s), 1385(s), 1152(w), 1100(s), 1015(s), 883(w), 821(m), 798(m), 754(s), 701(m), 664(m), 593(w), 561(w), 530(m), 456(m). Elemental analysis (%): calcd for Zn5O18N2C30H30: C 34.86; H 2.92, N 2.71; found: C 33.11, H 3.07, N 2.90. Zn3(OH)2(BDC)2 · 2DEF (2): Zn(NO3)2 · 6H2O (0.445 g, 1.5 mmol) and H2BDC (0.083 g, 0.5 mmol) were dissolved in 10-mL DEF, into which 3 drops of 35% H2O2 was added. The colorless solution was kept at 80 °C for one day. Many rectangular colorless crystals were collected in a yield of 0.189 g (66% yield based on H2BDC). IR(KBr, cm−1): 3343(s), 2979(m), 2938(m), 1646(s), 1585(s), 1504(m), 1444(s), 1402(s), 1298(m), 1266(m), 1214(m), 1152(w), 1108(m), 1016(w), 934(w), 887(w), 824(m), 748(m), 647(w), 603(w), 520(w), 426(w). Elemental analysis (%): calcd for Zn3O12N2C26H32: C 44.91; H 4.63, N 4.03; found: C 44.69, H 4.31, N 3.69.
