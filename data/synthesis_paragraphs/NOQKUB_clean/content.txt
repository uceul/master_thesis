A mixture of CoCl2⋅6 H2O (0.019 g, 0.008 mmol), H3imda (0.006 g, 0.004 mmol), and 4,4′‐dpbp (0.025 g, 0.008 mmol) was added to a solution of H2O/glycol (14:1; 15 mL) and stirred for 10 min. The resulting solution was heated in a 25 mL stainless‐steel reactor with a Teflon liner at 180 °C for 6 days. After a period of approximately 20 h of cooling to room temperature, orange prismatic crystals of 4 were obtained, isolated by filtration, and washed with water. Yield: 64 %; elemental analysis (%) calcd for C98H94N12O22Co3: C 59.79, H 4.81, N 8.54; found: C 59.53, H 4.63, N 8.62.
