A total of 0.20 mmol of Zn(NO3)2·6H2O (60 mg) and 0.10 mmol of H3TPO (41 mg) were dissolved in a mixed solvent of DEF/EtOH/H2O (8 mL, v/v/v = 1:2:1) and then sealed in a Teflon-lined autoclave (30 mL). The autoclave was heated at 120 °C for 72 h and cooled to room temperature at a rate of 0.1 °C min–1. Colorless prism crystals of complex 1 were isolated by filtration, washed with EtOH, and dried in air at ambient temperature. Yield: 68% (based on H3TPO). Elem anal.
