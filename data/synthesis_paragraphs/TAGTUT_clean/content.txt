In a 20 mL glass vial, 102.6 mg of Mg(NO3)2·6H2O and 43.2 mg of H2NDC were dissolved in a mixture of 4.0 g of DMA and 2.0 g of DMPU. After addition of 28 μL of HFP, the vial was sealed and placed in a 120 °C oven for 5 days. Colorless block crystals were obtained after cooling to room temperature. The yield was about 66% based on Mg. Pure sample was obtained by filtering and washing the raw product with DMA.
