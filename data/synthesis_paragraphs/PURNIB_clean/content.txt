Synthesis of [CuL]2KH[SiW11CoO39(H2O)]⋅2H2O (3): A mixture of K6[SiW11CoO39(H2O)]⋅3H2O (0.304 g, ca. 0.1 mmol), CuCl2⋅2H2O (0.034 g, 0.2 mmol), and bimb (0.042 g, 0.2 mmol) was dissolved in 10 mL distilled water and stirred at room temperature for 1 h. The pH value of the above mixture was adjusted to ca. 3.5 with 1.0 m HCl, and then the suspension was transferred into a Teflon‐lined autoclave and kept under autogenous pressure at 160 °C for three days. After the autoclave was slowly cooled to room temperature, yellow crystals of 3 were obtained by filtration and washed with distilled water (57 % yield based on W). Anal.
