First, 0.710 g P2O5 was dissolved in 10 ml water contained in a 23 ml teflon pot (this reaction is very vigorous). Then, 0.443 g BeSO4·4H2O and 0.186 g 1,3-diaminopropane were added sequentially (starting ratio of template:Be:P=1:1:4). The unstirred vessel was sealed and placed in an oven at 180°C for 2 days. Upon removal from the oven and cooling over several hours, the resulting solids were recovered by suction filtration and rinsing with acetone, resulting in intergrown lumps and a few loose crystals of the title compound. Very intergrown masses of the same compound also form from a starting ratio of template:Be:P of 1:1:2 and 1:1:3. The powder diffraction pattern of well-ground crystals of [H3N(CH2)3NH3]·Be3(HPO4)4 matched a simulated pattern, based on the single-crystal structure. Caution! take all appropriate precautions due to the toxicity of Be, especially with respect to dust contamination.
