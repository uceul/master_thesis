 A mixture of ZnCl2 (0.020 g, 0.15 mmol), H4L1 (0.023 g, 0.05 mmol), H2O (3 mL), MeCN (3 mL), and 3 drops of HCl (1 M) was sealed in a Teflon-lined stainless steel vessel (15 mL), which was heated at 120 °C for 1 day and then cooled to room temperature at a rate of 10 °C h−1. Colorless block crystals of 4 were collected in 69% yield (0.019 g, based on H4L1). Anal. Calcd for C76H60N2O32Zn2: C, 55.52; H, 3.68; N, 1.70%. Found: C, 55.36; H, 3.98; N, 1.34%.
