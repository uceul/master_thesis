Synthesis of IRMOF‐1, IRMOF‐3, and MOF‐2: Both IRMOF‐1 and IRMOF‐3 were synthesized based on a modified procedure reported by Eddaoudi and co‐workers.13 For IRMOF‐1 synthesis, a solution comprised of 18.0 mmol (5.35 g) of Zn(NO3)2·6H2O and 5.99 mmol (0.995 g) of 1,4‐benzenedicarboxylic acid in 180 mL DMF was heated at 105 °C for 18 h in a Schott Duran® bottle under autogenous pressure. For IRMOF‐3 synthesis, 22.9 mmol (6.81 g) of Zn(NO3)2·6H2O and 8.28 mmol (1.5 g) of 2‐amino‐1,4‐benzenedicarboxylic acid were dissolved in 200 mL of DMF. This solution was heated at 105 °C for 18 h in a Schott Duran® bottle under autogenous pressure. After being cooled to room temperature, each reactant mixture was decanted, and the remaining crystals were washed with fresh DMF several times. MOF‐2 was synthesized following a procedure suggested by Sanchez‐Sanchez and co‐workers.33 For this synthesis, 7.24 mmol (1.56 g) of Zn(O2CCH3)2·2H2O was dissolved in 11 mL of D.I. water to form zinc solution, whereas 4.1 mmol (0.68 g) of 1,4‐benzenedicarboxylic acid was dissolved in 15.8 mL of DMF to form organic linker solution. The zinc solution was then added to the organic linker solution under continuous stirring at room temperature forming a white precipitate after 24 h. This white precipitate was filtered and washed with fresh DMF several times. The resulting as‐synthesized Zn‐MOFs were then soaked in fresh DMF for stable storage. Desolvated IRMOFs and MOF‐2 were prepared following the procedure to form Zn‐MOF (thermal), as previously stated. The successful synthesis of these MOF materials was confirmed by their XRD patterns, which were in good agreement with their simulated XRD patterns (Figure S5, data for IRMOF‐1, IRMOF‐3 and CIF‐file20 for MOF‐2). The retention of the porous structures of these MOFs after being subjected to thermal drying process was demonstrated by their type I N2 adsorption isotherms at –196 °C (Figure S6) indicating the presence of micropores, as evidenced by abrupt increase in the amount of N2 adsorbed in the low P/P0 region (< 0.1). Their permanent porosity after desolvation was further confirmed by their surface areas (Table 1, SNLDFT: ca. 780 m2 g–1 for IRMOFs; ca. 210 m2 g–1 for MOF‐2) as well as pore volumes (Table 1, VPORE: ca. 0.49 cm3 g–1 for IRMOFs; ca. 0.19 cm3 g–1 for MOF‐2).
