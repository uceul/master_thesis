A mixture of Cu(NO3)2·(H2O)2.5 (24 mg, 0.1 mmol) and H4ABTC (18 mg, 0.05 mmol) was dissolved in DMF/ethanol/H2O (5:3:1) at room temperature in a 25 mL beaker. Sufficient 2 M HNO3 was added until the mixture became clear. The mixture was left undisturbed at 60 °C for 2 days to give blue-green, polyhedral crystals. Yield: 61% (based on H4ABTC). Elemental anal. Calcd C22H26N4O13Cu2 (680): C, 38.82; H, 3.85; N, 8.24. Found: C, 38.91; H, 3.78; N, 8.32.
