§ Synthesis of UTSA-38: a mixture of 2,6-naphthalenedicarboxylic acid (0.216 g, 1 mmol) and Zn(NO3)2·6H2O (0.595 g, 2 mmol) in DMF (35 mL) was sonicated for 10 min and heated in a 50 mL vial with a screw cap at 120 °C for 24 h. Block-shaped crystals were collected, washed with DMF and dried in air with 80% yield. Elemental analysis (%) calcd for C52.5H67.5N5.5O26.5Zn4: C, 43.15; H, 4.65; N, 5.27; found: C, 42.91; H, 4.26; N, 5.38.
