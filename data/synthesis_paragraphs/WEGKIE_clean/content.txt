Synthesis of H4[(Cu4Cl)3(BTC)8]2[SiW12O40]·(C4H12N)6·3H2O (NENU-15): A mixture of CuCl2·2H2O (0.18 g, 1 mmol), H3BTC (0.21 g, 1 mmol) and K4SiW12O40·9H2O (0.32 g, 0.1 mmol) in distilled water (10 mL) was stirred for 30 min. The pH was adjusted to 4.5 by dropwise addition of 50% (CH3)4NOH solution. Then the turbid mixture was sealed in a Teflon-lined autoclave and heated at 180 °C for 72 hours, then cooled to room temperature. Cyan cube-shaped crystals were collected with yield 62% based on Cu.
