 A solution of H4btec (0.10 mmol) in 5 mL H2O was adjusted to pH 6 with a dilute NaOH solution. Then Cd(NO3)2·4H2O (0.20 mmol) in 5 mL H2O and obtz (0.20 mmol) in 5 mL MeOH were added with stirred. The mixture was sealed in a Teflon-lined stainless steel vessel (25 mL) and heated to 160 °C for 48 h. It was allowed to cool to room temperature (20 °C) at the rate of 5 °C per hour. Colorless crystals 1 were collected with a yield of 42% (based on obtz). Anal. calcd for C34H37Cd2N12O13.5: C, 38.72; H, 3.54; N, 15.94%. Found: C, 38.70; H, 3.57; N, 15.91%.
