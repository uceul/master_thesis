0.005 g (0.0068 mmol) H4pbtd-OMe and 0.015 g (0.064 mmol) Cu(NO3)2·2.5H2O dissolved in 1.5 mL N,N-dimethylacetamide (DMA) with 4 drops HBF4 (48% min w/w aqueous solution) were added to a 2 mL glass vial. The reaction was kept at 85 °C in an oven for 72 h. The resulting blue-teal crystals of Cu2(H2O)2(pbtd-OMe)·xS (PCN-28·xS, S = noncoordinated solvent molecule) were then decanted, washed with fresh DMA, and collected.
