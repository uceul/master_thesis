 A mixture of Co(NO3)2·6H2O (58.2 mg, 0.2 mmol) and HIN (24.6 mg, 0.2 mmol) was treated in DMF (10 mL) and deionized H2O (two drops) under ultrasonic irradiation to produce a clear solution. The resulting mixture was sealed in a 25 mL Teflon-lined reaction vessel, heated at 140 °C for 3 d, and slowly cooled to room temperature. Bright red block crystals of 1 were handpicked under a microscope and washed by DMF several times, yielding 32% based on HIN. Elemental analysis (%) for C42H62Co6N8O31 (1528.58): calcd C 33.00, H 4.09, N 7.33; Found C 33.04, H 3.91, N 6.99. IR (KBr pellet, cm−1): 3297 s, 3215 s, 2970 w, 2897 w, 2345 w, 2312 w, 1589 vs, 1380 vs, 1225 w, 1061 w, 829 w, 771 m, 694 s. Two infrared bands of approximately equal intensity at 2970 and 2897 cm−1 are attributed to the C(O)–H stretching vibration, which confirms the presence of disordered DMF molecules.
