 A mixture of Cd(NO3)2·4H2O (154 mg, 0.5 mmol), H2BDC (42 mg, 0.25 mmol), DATRZ (25 mg, 0.25 mmol) and 6 mL DMF/H2O (v/v = 2:1) solution was stirred in a 20 mL closed vial at room temperature. The mixed solution was heated at 100 °C for 5 days and then it was slowly cooled to room temperature. Colorless block-shaped crystals suitable for X-ray diffraction analysis were isolated in 45% yield based on Cd(II). IR data (KBr pellet, cm−1): 3419(b), 1644(s) 1571(s), 1492(m), 1382(s), 1105(w), 995(w), 837(w), 750(m), 657(w), 547(w).
