 A mixture of Cu(NO3)2·3H2O (24.2 mg, 0.1 mmol) and H4L (20.4 mg, 0.05 mmol) and two drops of HNO3 (0.1 M) in DMF (5 mL) was sealed in a 10 mL screw-capped vial. The vial was placed in an oven at 105 °C for 72 h, and gradually cooled to room temperature at a rate of 5 °C min−1. Blue rod crystals of 1 were collected by filtration and washed with DMF. The yield was ca. 33.3 mg (69.4%, based on H4L). Anal. Calcd for C41.5H63.5CuN8.5O13.5: C, 51.87; H, 6.66; N, 12.39. Found: C, 51.81; H, 6.73; N, 12.27.
