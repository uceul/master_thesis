 A mixture of Zn(CH3COO)2·2H2O (0.219 g, 1 mmol) and L′ (0.306 g, 1 mmol) was added to 10 mL distilled water at room temperature. When the pH value of the mixture was adjusted to about 8.5 with NaOH solution (1 M), the mixture was transferred to a 25 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel vessel and heated to 160 °C for 72 h and then cooled to room temperature at a rate of 5 °C h−1. Colorless block crystals of 1 were obtained in ca. 88% (based on Zn(CH3COO)2·2H2O). Elemental analyses calcd for C20H26N8O14Zn3 (798.60): C, 30.08; H, 3.28; N, 14.09. Found: C, 30.14; H, 3.24; N, 14.07%. Selected IR data (KBr, cm−1): 3425s, 1642s, 1475s, 1388s, 1320s, 1288s, 1146s, 963s, 922s, 781s, 738s, 697s.
