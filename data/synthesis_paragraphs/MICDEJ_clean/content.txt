Compound 5 was prepared by using Mn(NO3)2·6H2O (29.1 mg, 0.1 mmol) and H3BCPBA (39.4 mg, 0.1 mmol) containing 4′,4-bipy (15.6 mg, 0.1 mmol) in 8 mL of DMF/H2O (3:1, v/v). The final mixture was placed in a Parr Teflon-lined stainless steel vessel (15 mL) under autogenous pressure and heated at 95 °C for 3 days. Colorless crystals were obtained (yield: 66% based on Mn).
