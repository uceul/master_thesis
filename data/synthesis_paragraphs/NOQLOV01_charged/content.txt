[NH3(CH2)2NH3][In(C2O4)2]2·5H2O (II). A mixture of In(NO3)3·6H2O (96 mg, 0.25 mmol), oxalic acid (40 mg, 0.625 mmol), H2SeO4 (0.17 mL, 0.103 mmol) and 36% HCl (0.1 mL) in 9 mL of distilled water were stirred for 30 min. After 0.025 mL ethylenediamine (0.375 mmol) was added, the mixture was sealed into an autoclave equipped with a Teflon liner (15 mL) and heated at 120 °C for 3 days. The autoclave was then cooled at 10 °C/h to room temperature. Colorless octahedral single crystals of II were obtained in 56% yield based on indium. No crystals with a morphology other than octahedron were present in the product, indicating the phase purity of the as-synthesized material. The initial and final pH values of the solution did not show appreciable change and were close to 2. Elemental and ICP analysis results for compound II, C10H20In2N2O21: In, 29.89; C, 16.54; H, 1.21; N, 3.64%. Calcd.: In, 31.29; C, 16.37; H, 2.75; N, 3.82%.
