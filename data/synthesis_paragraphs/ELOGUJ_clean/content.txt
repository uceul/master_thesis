A mixture of Na2WO4·2H2O (0.33 g, 0.1 mmol), CoCl2·6H2O (0.12 g, 0.05 mmol), bimb (0.041 g, 0.02 mmol) NH4VO3 (0.035 g, 0.3 mmol) and H2O (15 mL) was stirred for 1 h. Then the solution was sealed in a 23 mL Teflon-lined auto autoclave and heated at 160 °C for 3 days with a starting pH = 3.0 adjusted by 1 M HCl. After slow cooling to room temperature, reddish brown crystals of 1 were filtered, washed with distilled water and dried at room temperature (42% yield based on W). Elemental analysis: C24H20N8O40Co2VW12 (1) (3789.60). Anal. Calcd for 1: H, 0.59; C, 8.38; N, 3.26; Co, 3.43; W, 64.24 (%). Found: H, 0.64; C, 8.44; N, 3.31; Co, 3.37; W, 64.17 (%).
