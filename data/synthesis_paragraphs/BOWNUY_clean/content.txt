 A solution of Cu(CH3COO)2·4H2O (40 mg, 0.2 mmol) in 4 mL of methanol and nitric acid (0.2 mL) were added to a solution of H3BTT·2HCl·H2O·CH3OH (45 mg, 0.11 mmol) in 4 mL of DMF. The resulting mixture was stirred in air for 20 min and then heated to 85 °C for 48 h in a 25 mL Teflon-lined stainless container. After it had been cooled to RT and filtered, green crystals of compound 1 were recovered in 80% yield. IR (KBr, cm−1): 3434 s, 2924w, 1652s, 1417m, 1253w, 1103w, 792w, 665w.
