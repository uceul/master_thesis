A mixture of ZnCl2 (0.0680g, 0.5 × 10–3mol), H4BTEC (0.1270 g, 0.5 × 10–3 mol) in DMF (10 ml) was sealed in a 23 mL Teflon‐lined autoclave and heated at 110 °C for 2 days. Then, slow cooling to room temperature. After being washed with DMF several times, 1 was collected as colorless shuttle‐shaped crystals with a yield of about 78 % (based on Zn). Anal. calcd. for 1: C 33.96; H 2.28 %; found: C 33.87; H 2.39 %.
