 A mixture of Zn(NO3)2·6H2O (0.045 mmol, 13.4 mg), H5L1 (0.018 mmol, 8.1 mg), HCl (0.15 mL, 1 mol L−1) and DMF/H2O (6 mL, 5/1, v/v) was sealed in a 23 mL Teflon-lined autoclave and heated at 90 °C for 72 h. After cooling to room temperature at a speed of 10 °C h−1, colorless block crystals of C23H11.6Zn2O10.8 were obtained (65% yield based on Zn), washed with DMF/H2O and dried in air. Elemental analysis (wt%) found for 1: C, 46.62; H, 1.72; calcd: C, 46.66; H, 1.96.
