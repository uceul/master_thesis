A mixture of H2pddb (0.0128 g, 0.04 mmol), CdI2 (0.0366 g, 0.1 mmol), 4-nitrobenzoic acid (0.0146 g, 0.10 mmol), water (6 mL), and MeCN (2 mL) was heated in 25 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel container at 160 °C for three days, and slowly cooled to room temperature at a rate of 5 °C/h. Thus, colorless block crystals 3 were achieved with a pure yield of 70% (based on H2pddb). Elemental analysis: Anal. Calc. for C38H24N2O9Cd2: C, 52.12; H, 2.76; N, 3.19. Found: C, 52.21; H, 2.93; N, 3.02%. IR (KBr, cm−1): 3433 (bw), 3081 (w), 2928 (w), 2484 (w), 2249 (w), 1704 (w), 1604 (m), 1557 (s), 1455 (m), 1395 (s), 1349 (s), 1260 (w), 926 (w), 764 (m), 684 (m).
