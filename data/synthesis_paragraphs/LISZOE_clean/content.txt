 [LiY(BDC)2(H2O)·2(H2O)] (1) was synthesized under hydrothermal conditions. 0.31 g (1 mmol) of YCl3·6H2O, 0.21 g (1 mmol) of L-tartaric acid (H2Tart), 0.08 g (0.5 mmol) of terephthalic acid (H2BDC), and 0.14 g (3.5 mmol) of LiOH·H2O were dissolved in a mixture of distilled water (5 mL) and ethanol (5 mL). The reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature to homogeneity and then placed in a Teflon-lined stainless vessel (40 mL) and heated to 180 °C (1) for 3 days under autogenous pressure and afterwards cooled to room temperature. The resulting product contains large single crystals and microcrystalline powder, which were separated by ultrasound, filtered off individually, washed thoroughly with distilled water, and finally air-dried at room temperature. Yield: 27 mg, ca. 12% for both compounds based on Y. Elemental analysis: C16H14O11YLi (Mr = 478.12). Calcd: C, 40.19; H, 2.93%. Found: C, 39.6; H, 2.3%. Many attempts have been made for optimizing the synthesis conditions with and without adding H2Tart (ESI, Table S1). Even though H2Tart has not been incorporated into the crystal structure, an amount of 1 mmol was necessary to obtain the desired compound 1 as single-phase microcrystalline powder.
