In a typical synthesis, a mixture of BeSO4·4H2O (0.27 g), H3PO3 (0.42 g), pyridine (3.00 mL) and H2O (2.00 mL) was sealed in a 25 mL Teflon-lined autoclave and heated at 160 °C for 6 days. After cooling to room temperature, colorless rod-like crystals were recovered by filtration, washed with distilled water, and dried in air (76.8% yield based on beryllium). CHN elemental analysis confirmed its stoichiometry (Anal. Calcd: C 23.27, H 3.32, N 5.43; Found: C 23.16, H 3.19, N 5.36). The X-ray powder diffraction profile of the resulting product is in agreement with the simulated pattern from single-crystal X-ray structure data, indicating the purity of the as-synthesized sample of the title compound (Fig. S1).
