Preparation of In(OH)(1,4-NDC) 2H2O (1). Compound 1 was obtained by solvothermal reaction of mixture of 1.4-NDC (0.08 g, 0.37 mmol), InCl3·4H2O (0.05 g, 0.17 mmol), NaOH (0.3 ml, 1 mol/l), H2O (3 ml), and acetonitrile (8 ml) at 100 °C for 3 days. The colorless needle shaped crystals were obtained by filtration and washed by H2O several times with a yield of 75%. Anal. calcd for C12H11InO7 (%): C, 37.70; H, 2.88. Found: C, 37.14; H, 2.40. IR (KBr pellet, cm−1): 3409 (br, m), 2971 (w), 2063 (w), 1560 (s), 1458 (w), 1415 (s), 1363 (s), 1262 (w), 1130 (s), 871 (w), 820 (w), 784 (m), 578 (m), 449 (w).
