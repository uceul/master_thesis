Cd(ClO4)2·6H2O (75 mg, 0.18 mmol), 3-bpmp (99 mg, 0.37 mmol) and diphenic acid (44 mg, 0.18 mmol) were placed into 5 mL distilled H2O in a 15 mL screw-cap vial. The vial was sealed and heated in an oil bath at 80 °C for 72 h, whereupon it was cooled slowly to 25 °C. Colorless plates of 2 (84 mg, 67% yield based on Cd) were isolated after washing with distilled water and acetone, and drying in air. Anal. Calc. for C88H93Cd3ClN8O29 2: C, 50.35; H, 4.46; N, 5.34.
