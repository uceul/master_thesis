The mixture of H2L (21 mg, 0.054 mmol), CdCl2·2.5H2O (30 mg, 0.13 mmol) and 40% HBF4 (20 drops) in the mixture of DMF (10 ml), H2O (1 ml) and MeOH (1 ml) were placed in a small vial and heated at 65 °C for 48 h and then cooled to room temperature. Colorless prism crystals of the product were formed and collected by filtration (yield: 0.021 g, 50% based on H2L). Anal. Calc. for Cd2C40H74N20O31: C, 30.88; H, 4.79; N, 18.00.
