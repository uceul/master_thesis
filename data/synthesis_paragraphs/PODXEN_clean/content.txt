A mixture of Tipa (0.0225 g, 0.05 mmol), 4,4′-H2bpdc (0.0225 g, 0.08 mmol), Zn(NO3)2·6H2O (0.0560 g, 0.2 mmol), one drop of mineralization triethylamine, and DMF/MeOH/H2O/DMSO (v:v:v:v 4:1:1:2, 8 mL) was heated in a 20 mL scintillation vial at 120 °C for 24 h and then cooled to room temperature. Colorless block crystals of 1 were obtained and dried in air (38.4 mg, 64% yield, based on Tipa ligand). Elemental analysis for C54H45O13N9Zn2, Calcd. (%): C, 23.90; H, 1.66; N, 4.65. Found: C, 24.12; H, 1.64; N, 4.71.
