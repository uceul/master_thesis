For a typical procedure to synthesize polymer 1, 0.03 g (0.10 mmol) of Zn(NO3)2·6H2O, 0.06 g (0.30 mmol) of bpdc and 15.0 mL of DMF were placed in a 25 mL vial to form a solution under stirring. After being stirred in air for 4 h, the vial was set in a 50 mL beaker containing an EtOH solution (5.0 mL) of DIPA (DIPA = diisopropylanmine, 0.30 mL), and then sealed and left undisturbed for 3 days at 60 °C. The resulting colorless block-shaped crystals of polymer 1 were collected in 65% yield based on zinc. This complex was insoluble in common organic solvents, such as acetone, methanol, ethanol, dichloromethane, acetonitrile, chloroform, and DMF.
