Indium pyromellitate or MIL-117 was hydrothermally synthesized under autogenous pressure from mixture of elemental indium (In, Aldrich, 99.99%), 1,2,4,5-benzenetetracarboxylic acid (C6H2(CO2H)4 or H4btec, Aldrich, 96%) and distilled water with the following molar ratios 1: 0.1: 140. MIL-117 phase is formed only from reaction mixtures with very restrict In/H4btec molar ratios. When the amount of pyromellitic acid is increased in the reaction mixture, the phase In(OH)(H2btec)Â·H2O [38] is formed, whereas decreased acid amount results in the formation of the product with major amount of unreacted indium metal. Starting reagents (In: 220 mg, 2 mmol; H4btec: 50 mg, 0.2 mmol; H2O: 5 ml, 278 mmol) were placed into 23 ml Teflon-lined stainless-steel Parr autoclave and treated at 483 K for 24 h pH value remained 2 during the crystallization process. Obtained thin plate-like crystals were continuously rinsed with distilled water and dried at room temperature.
