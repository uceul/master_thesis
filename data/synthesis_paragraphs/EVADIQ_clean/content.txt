 A mixture of Dy(NO3)3·6H2O (21.9 mg, 0.05 mmol) and 2,2′-bipyridine-5,5′-dicarboxylic acid (24.4 mg, 0.1 mmol) was dissolved in a mixture solution of N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF, 7 mL), dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO, 1 mL) and water (1 mL), then it was stirred at room temperature for 30 min. After that it was transferred into a 20 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave and heated at 120 °C for 4 days. After slow cooling to room temperature, colorless rectangular crystals of 3·Dy were obtained by filtration (field 79% based on Dy). Elemental analysis for C108H128Dy4N24O41 (Mr: 3149.9): C, 41.14; N, 10.67; H, 4.06%. Found: C, 41.11; N, 10.65; H, 4.08%. IR (KBr pellet, cm−1) for 3·Dy: 3419(br, s), 2557(w), 2360(w), 1689(vs), 1594(vs), 1419(vs), 1309(s), 1124(m), 1022(s), 860(s), 779(vs), 667(w), 553(vs).
