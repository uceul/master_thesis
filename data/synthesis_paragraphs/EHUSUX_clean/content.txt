H4LIV (50 mg, 0.093 mmol) and Cu(NO3)2·2.5H2O (0.17 g, 0.72 mmol) were dissolved in a mixture of N,N′-dimethylformamide (DMF, 6.0 mL) and H2O (0.5 mL), and the solution was placed in a pressure tube (15 mL). Upon addition of 6 M HCl (15 μL), the tube was capped and heated at 90 °C for 16 h, and a large amount of microcrystalline product precipitated. The blue crystals were collected by filtration, washed with warm DMF, and dried in air. Yield: 58.6 mg (80% based on H4LIV). Selected FTIR (cm–1): 3404 (br, w), 2927 (w), 1657 (vs), 1626 (s), 1588 (m), 1494 (m), 1435 (m), 1417 (m), 1367 (vs), 1308 (w), 1284 (w), 1254 (m), 1187 (w), 1149 (w), 1094 (s), 1062 (m), 923 (w), 888 (w), 778 (m), 727 (s), 701 (w), 686 (w), 660 (s), 632 (w).
