A mixture of Cd(NO3)2·4H2O (14.6 mg, 0.05 mmol), p-BrPhH3IDC (15.6 mg, 0.05 mmol), Et3N (0.056 mL, 0.4 mmol), 4,4′-bipy (7.8 mg, 0.05 mmol), and CH3CN/H2O (3/4, 7 mL) were sealed in 25 mL Teflon-lined bomb, which was heated to 160 °C for 72 h. And then cooled to room temperature at a rate of 10 °C/h. Good quality colorless crystals for 6 were filtered off, washed with distilled water and dried in air (77% yield based on Cd). Anal. Calcd. for C32H26Br2N6O12Cd2: C, 35.85; H, 2.43; N, 7.84%. Found: C, 35.57; H, 2.21; N, 7.65%.
