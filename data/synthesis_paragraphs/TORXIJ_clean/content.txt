 A mixture containing Htz (14.0 mg, 0.2 mmol) and CuCl2·2H2O (34.0 mg, 0.2 mmol) was dissolved in a mixed methanol–water solution (v:v = 4:1, 10.0 mL), and the initial pH value of the mixture was adjusted to ca. 6 using an aqueous NaOH solution (0.25 M). The resulting mixture was then transferred into a Parr Teflon-lined stainless steel vessel (23.0 mL) and heated to 130 °C for 72 h under autogenous pressure. After the mixture was cooled to room temperature at a rate of 2.3 °C h−1, blue block-shaped crystals suitable for X-ray analysis were obtained directly, washed with methanol, and dried in air (Yield: 40% based on Htz). Anal. Calcd for C5.40H9.60Cl2Cu3N16O1.40: C 11.13, H 1.66, N 38.47%. Found: C 10.06, H 1.68, N 38.25%. IR (KBr, cm−1): 3405(br), 3098(w), 1451(m), 1331(m), 1267(m), 1122(s), 1030(s), 926(m), 694(w).
