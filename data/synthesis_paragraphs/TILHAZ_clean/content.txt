 CoCl2·6H2O (0.081 g, 3.40 × 10−4 mol) was dissolved in EtOH (2 mL), and mixed with a DMF (4 mL) solution of adipic acid (0.050 g, 3.42 × 10−4 mol). The solution was reacted in a glass serum bottle at 100 °C for 24 h, and then cooled to room temperature. Pink rod-shaped crystals and a purple polycrystalline solid formed, which were filtered, and washed briefly with the mother liquor. Yield: 50%. FT-IR (KBr pellet, cm−1): 3441, 2955, 2932, 2873, 1685, 1662, 1592, 1409. UV/vis (diffuse reflectance spectrum, λmax): 518 nm. Anal. Calcd for Co2C18H33N2O11.5: C, 37.32; H, 5.74; N, 4.84. Found: C, 35.58; H, 5.81; N, 5.78.
