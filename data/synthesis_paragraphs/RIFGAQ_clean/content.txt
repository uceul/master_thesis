Large crystals suitable for single‐crystal X‐ray determination were synthesized according to the procedure described in the literature.9 A mixture of Cu(NO3)2⋅3 H2O (0.24 g, 1 mmol) and H5PV2Mo10O40⋅34.5 H2O (0.2 g, 0.083 mmol) in distilled water (10 mL) was stirred for 20 min and then H3BTC (0.21 g, 1 mmol) and [(CH3)4N]OH (0.09 g, 1 mmol) were added successively. The mixture was stirred for 30 min at room temperature. The turbid mixture (pH 2–3) was then sealed in a Teflon‐lined autoclave and heated at 180 °C for 24 h, followed by slow cooling to room temperature. Green octahedral crystals were then collected.
