SUMOF-3, which is an interpenetrated analogue of IRMOF-8, was synthesized by first dissolving Zn(NO3)2·6H2O (117 mg, 0.39 mmol) and 2,6-naphthalenedicarboxylic acid (H2NDC, 54.8 mg, 0.25 mmol; Aldrich, CAS number 1141-38-4) in 5 mL of DMF in a 20 mL glass vial. The solution was solvothermally treated at 130 °C for 28 h, under static conditions. Yellow crystals formed (yield ≈ 70 mg). The crystals were filtered, washed with DMF, and dried at room temperature. The chemical formula of activated SUMOF-3 is [Zn4O(NDC)3], as deduced from the structure refinement and the elemental analysis (wt%): exp: C 46.36, H 2.240, N 0.051; calcd: C 46.99, H 1.970, N 0.
