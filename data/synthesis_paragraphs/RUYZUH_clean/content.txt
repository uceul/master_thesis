Compound 1 was prepared by the hydrothermal method: a mixture of Na2MoO4·2H2O (1.452 g), MnSO4·H2O (0.676 g), ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA) (0.744 g), H3PO4 (2 mL), HF (1 mL), ethylenediamine (0.5 mL) was dissolved in 30 mL of water. The mixture was stirred for 2 h at room temperature and then sealed in a 50 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave and heated at 180 °C for 7 days. After cooling to room temperature, the deep-red block crystals were harvested. Then the crystals were washed with distilled water, filtered and dried at room temperature (yield 48.6% based on Mo) [31]. In our syntheses, the use of EDTA species was necessary for compound 1, although it was not involved in the final structure. It is also interesting that if no EDTA was introduced into the reaction mixture, another {Mo5P2}-based composite compound was obtained with very low yields.
