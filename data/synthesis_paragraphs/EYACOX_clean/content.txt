 Sandy beige polyhedral crystals were grown from a solution of 1,1′-butadiynebenzene-3,3′,5,5′-tetracarboxylic acid (H4BBTC, 5.0 mg), Eu(NO3)3·nH2O (13 mg), DMF (0.4 ml), methanol (two drops) and HNO3 (0.03 ml, 1 M in DMF) at 85 °C for 17 h (0.23 g, 86% based on H4BBTC). Anal. Calcd for C53H71Eu2N8O26: C: 40.33; H: 4.65; N: 7.28; Found: C: 40.78; H: 4.24; N: 7.00. IR (KBr disc, cm−1): 3395 (br), 2928 (w), 1657 (s), 1433 (s), 1380 (s), 1103 (m), 780 (m), 717 (m), 672 (m).
