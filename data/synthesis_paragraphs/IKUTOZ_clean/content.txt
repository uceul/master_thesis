 Compound 2 was obtained by solvothermal methods through the following procedure: 2 ml solution of DMF containing 0.0166 mmol of the ligand 9,10-anthracenedicarboxylic acid (4.5 mg) and 0.025 mmol of ligand 2,5-diaminoterephthalic acid (4.5 mg) are prepared in a vial of 8 ml of volume. To this solution, 2 ml of DMF containing 0.05 mmol of Dy(NO3)3·6H2O (22.8 mg) is added. The reaction mixture was heated in a closed vial at 95 °C in an oven for 24 h. Pale yellow crystals were obtained. Yield: 45% based on Dy(III) ion. Elemental analysis of C55H57Dy2N6O18 (2), calcd: C 46.68, H 4.06, N 5.94; found: C 46.32, H 3.98, N 5.13.
