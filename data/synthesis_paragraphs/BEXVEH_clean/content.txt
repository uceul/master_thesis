 A mixture of Cu(NO3)2·2½H2O (11.6 mg, 0.05 mmol) and H4L (7.2 mg, 0.02 mmol) was dissolved in 8 ml of DMA–water (1:1). Then, 0.5 ml of 12(N) HNO3 was added. The mixture was heated for 48 h in a bath-reactor at 80 °C and after cooling to room temperature, green crystals were obtained, separated by filtration, washed with water and DMA and then dried in air. The yield was 52% based on the metal salt.
