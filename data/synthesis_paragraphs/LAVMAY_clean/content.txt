Synthesis of single crystals of {Zn3(Atz)3(PO4)}⋅(H2O)3.5 (1⋅(H2O)3.5): Colorless crystals of 1⋅(H2O)3.5 in the shape of thick square plates were obtained from the reaction of a mixture containing ZnCO3⋅2 Zn(OH)2 (0.1 g), H3PO4 (0.03 g), 3‐amino‐1,2,4‐triazole (0.4 g), NH4OH (30 %, 0.08 mL), methanol (2 mL), and water (2 mL) at 180 °C for 2 days (yield: ca. 70 % based on zinc). Initial pH 8.0–8.5; final pH 6.5–7.0. Elemental analysis (%) calcd for C6H16N12O7.5PZn3: C 11.94, H 2.67, N 27.86; found: C 11.97, H 2.70, N 27.83. The pH was crucial; anything below this pH resulted in the formation of a mixture of unidentified phases along with 1. The crystals of 1⋅(H2O)3.5 grew as a crop of colorless crystals, which were mostly twinned and heavily intergrown, but a good single crystal was chosen. Our attempts to locate the CO2 within the pores of 1 using single crystal X‐ray diffraction experiments have so far been unsuccessful.
