A mixture containing H4L (20 mg, 0.05 mmol), L1 (7.68 mg, 0.05 mmol), and Cd(NO3)2·4H2O (30 mg, 0.1 mmol) in DMF (2 mL) and ethanol (1 mL) was heated at 100 °C under autogenous pressure in a Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave for 72 h, followed by cooling to room temperature at the rate of 5 °C h–1. Compound 1 was isolated as colorless block-shaped crystals in ∼45% yield. Anal. Calcd for C41H47N5O15Cd2: C, 45.82; H, 4.41; N, 6.52%. Found: C, 45.40 ; H, 4.81 N, 6.24.
