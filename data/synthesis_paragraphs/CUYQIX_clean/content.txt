ZnSO4·7H2O (53 mg, 0.18 mmol), bpmp (99 mg, 0.37 mmol), and tricarballylic acid (33 mg, 0.19 mmol) were placed into 5 mL of distilled H2O in a 15 mL screw-cap glass vial. The vial was sealed and heated in an oil bath at 80 °C for 72 h, whereupon it was cooled slowly to 25 °C. Colorless blocks of 2 (33 mg, 0.024 mmol, 39% yield based on Zn) were isolated after washing with distilled water and acetone, and drying in air. Anal.
