 A mixture of Cu(NO3)2 (0.1 mmol), bib (0.1 mmol), CH3OH (2 mL) and deionised water (10 mL) was placed in a Teflon lined stainless steel vessel, heated to 160 °C for 3 days under autogenous pressure, and then cooled to room temperature at a rate of 5 °C h−1. Yellow crystals were obtained. The resulting crystals were filtered off, washed with water and dried in air. C28H40CuN5O7 (622.19). Elemental analysis (%) calcd: C, 54.05; H, 6.48; N, 11.26.
