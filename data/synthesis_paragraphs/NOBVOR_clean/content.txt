 A mixture of H3TDA (0.0314 g, 0.2 mmol), bpy (0.0156 g, 0.1 mmol), Co(ClO4)2·6H2O (0.0366 g, 0.1 mmol), GdCl3·6H2O (0.0371 g, 0.1 mmol), LiOH·H2O (0.0084 g, 0.2 mmol) and H2O (5 mL) was sealed in a 25 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel reactor heated at 120 °C for 72 h, and subsequently cooled to room temperature at a rate of 1.2 °C h−1. Orange block crystals of 2 in ca. 35% yield (based on Co) were collected. Anal. calcd for C38H37.5N12O14.75Co3 (%): C 42.45, H 3.52, N 15.63. Found (%): C 42.18, H 3.94, N 15.65.
