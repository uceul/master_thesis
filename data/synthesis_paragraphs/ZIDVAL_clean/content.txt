Recently, a large number of MOFs based on mixed-ligands have been reported [8], [9], [10], [11]. It is known that combining different ligands in a complex offers greater tenability of structural frameworks than using a single ligand, and the use of mixed-ligand is a good choice for the construction of new polymeric structures. Many complexes based on the BIBP (BIBP = 4,4′-bisimidazolylbiphenyl) have been reported [12], [13], [14], [15], [16]. In this paper, we use aromatic carboxylic acid sdb (4,4′-sulfonyldibenzoic acid) as a co-ligand to coordinate with metal Mn(II) cation. One new coordination compound with intriguing structure was synthesized, that is, [Mn3(BIBP)(sdb)(NO2−)2(H2O)2]n 2DMF (1): a mixture of MnCl2·4H2O (19.8 mg, 0.1 mmol), sdb (30.4 mg, 0.1 mmol), and BIBP (28.8 mg, 0.1 mmol) was dissolved in 2 mL of distilled water and 6 mL of DMF. The final mixture was sealed in a 15 mL Parr Teflon-lined stainless-steel vessel and heated at 95 °C for 3 days, and then the reaction system was cooled to room temperature. Colorless diamond bulk crystals of 1 were obtained, washed with water, and dried under ambient conditions (yields: 58% for 1 based on BIBP).
