A solution of Na3PO4 (5 mmol), Na2WO4·2H2O (10 mmol), NiCl2·6H2O (2 mmol) and en (0.33 mL) in H2O (20 mL) acidified by diluted HCl solution (pH 1.0), was refluxed for 8 h. The resulting reaction mixture was adjusted to pH 5.5 with NaOH solution (12 M), and then sealed in a 30 mL Teflon-lined autoclave at 175 °C for 7 days. After cooling to room temperature, dark-blue block-shaped crystals of 1 were isolated (19% yield based on W element). Anal.
