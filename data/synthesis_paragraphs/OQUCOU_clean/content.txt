The mixture of Cd(CH3COO)2·2H2O (0.2 mmol, 0.053 g), (R)-H3CIA (0.026 g, 0.1 mmol), 1, 4-DIB (0.15 mmol, 0.032 g), DMA(3 ml) and H2O (1 ml) was sealed in a 20 ml vial and heated to 100 °C for three days. After cooling to room-temperature, the colourless block crystals 1-D were separated from the mixture by filtration (Yield: 35%). Elemental analysis (%) calcd for 1-D (C36H31Cd2.50N5O16.50): C 40.08, H 2.90, N 6.49; found: C 38.76, H 3.02, N 6.27.
