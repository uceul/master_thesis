Synthesis of Co2(4,4′-bpy)3(ox)(As2W18O62)2(H2bpy)·2H2O (1): A mixture of K6As2W18O62 (0.5 g), C2H2O4 (0.001 g), Co(NO3)2 (0.058 g), and 4,4′-bipyridine (0.14 g), was dissolved in water (8 ml) and ethanol (2 ml) at room temperature. After stirring for 30 min, the suspension was placed into a 15 ml Teflon-lined stainless-steel container and heated at 160 °C for 5 days. After slow cooling to room temperature, pink block crystals were filtered, washed with distilled water, and dried in desiccators at room temperature to give a yield of 64% based on K6As2W18O62.
