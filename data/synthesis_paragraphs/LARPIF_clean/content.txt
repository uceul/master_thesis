The mixture of FeCl2·4H2O (0.2 mmol, 0.04 g), m-H2BDC (0.5 mmol, 0.163 g), NaOH (1 mmol, 0.04 g) and DMF (10 mL) was sealed in a Teflon-lined autoclave and heated at 130 °C for 5 days, followed by slow cooling to room temperature. After being washing with DMF several times, 2 was collected as dark yellow rod crystals with a yield of about 72% (based on Fe). Elem. Anal. Calc.: Fe, 12.9; Na, 6.6; C, 47.1; H, 1.8; N, 3.2. Found: Fe, 12.9; Na, 6.6; C, 46.9; H, 1.8; N, 3.3%.
