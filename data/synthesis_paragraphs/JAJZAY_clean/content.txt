 A mixture of H4L (5.0 mg, 10.7 μmol) and Zn(NO3)2·6H2O (10.0 mg, 33.6 μmol) was dissolved in DMF/acetonitrile (3 mL, 9:1, v/v) in a screw-capped vial (5 mL). The vial was capped and heated at 85 °C for 48 hours. The resulting pale-yellow crystals were collected by filtration and washed with DMF several times, with the yield of 63%. Anal. Calcd for C22H12O10N2SZn2: C, 37.89; H, 5.77; N, 8.36. Found: C, 37.97; H, 5.633; N, 8.29.
