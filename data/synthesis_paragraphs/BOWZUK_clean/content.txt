A mixture of Tipa (0.0225 g, 0.05 mmol), l-proline (0.0115 g, 0.10 mmol), Zn(NO3)2·6H2O (0.0560 g, 0.2 mmol), and DMF/MeOH/H2O (5 mL, v:v:v 3:1:1) was placed in a 20 mL scintillation vial at 100 °C for 12 h, followed by cooling to room temperature. The resulting mixture was washed with DMF and water, and colorless block crystals were collected and dried in air (38.4 mg, 64% yield, based on Tipa ligand).
