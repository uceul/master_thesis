‡ Synthesis: a mixture of Zn(NO3)2·6H2O (149 mg, 0.5 mmol), H2pt (42 mg, 0.25 mmol), Htrz (34 mg, 0.5 mmol), and water (10 mL) in a 23 mL Teflon reactor, under autogenous pressure at 140 °C for 5 d and then cooled to room temperature at a rate of 10 °C h−1. Colourless crystals of 1 were obtained (yield: 82 mg, 65% based on Zn). Elemental analysis (%) calcd for 1: C 29.78, H 3.18, N 14.21; found: C 29.65, H 3.24, N 14.33.
