 Co  2  (btec)(bipy)(DMF)  2  (2). A solution of H4btec (0.153 g, 6.0 mmol), 4,4′-bipy (0.115 g, 6.0 mmol), and Co(NO3)2·6H2O (0.348 g, 1.2 mmol) in 10 mL DMF was sealed in a 25 mL Teflon-lined autoclave and kept at 90 °C for 3 days. The obtained purple crystals were washed with DMF and C2H5OH, then dried at 60 °C in air (yield: 47%).
