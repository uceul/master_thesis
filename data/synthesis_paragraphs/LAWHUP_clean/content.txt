A mixture containing Cd(NO3)2·4H2O (0.0308 g, 0.1 mmol) and H2L (0.0224 g, 0.1 mmol) was dissolved in 5 mL of DMF/EtOH/H2O (1:2:2, v/v/v). The mixture was heated at 120 °C in a 20 mL Teflon-lined autoclave for 3 d. After the cooling treatment, reddish-brown crystals of 2 were separated and washed with mother liquor (yield: 80%, based on H2L ligand). Anal.
