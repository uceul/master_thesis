Synthesis and Initial Characterization: FJ‐8 was hydrothermally synthesized under autogenous pressure. In a typical synthesis, a mixture of ZnO (0.093 g, 1.14 mmol), H3PO3 (0.3 mL, 50 wt %), Ni(en)3Cl2·2H2O (0.395 g, 1.14 mmol) and H2O (2.5 mL) in a molar ratio of 1·2·1·130 was stirred under ambient conditions. The resulting gel was sealed in a Teflon‐lined steel autoclave and heated at 160 °C for 7 days and then cooled to room temperature. The resulting product, consisting of single crystals in the form of light‐purple prisms, was recovered by filtration, washed with distilled water and air‐dried. Yield: 0.064 g, (23 % yield based on ZnO). The XRD powder pattern is in accord with the structure simulated on the basis of the single‐crystal X‐ray analysis, indicating phase purity. Inductively coupled plasma (ICP) spectrometric analysis gave the contents of Zn (calcd. 26.83 wt %; found 25.17 wt % ), P (calcd. 16.95 wt %; found 15.41 wt %) and Ni (calcd. 8.03 wt %; found 7.86 wt % ) and indicated a Zn:P:Ni ratio of 3:4:1. C4H24N4NiO14P4Zn3 (731.0): calcd. C 6.57, H 3.31, N 7.66; found C 6.48, H 3.26, N 7.61. IR (KBr):  = 3345 s, 3280 s, 3274 s, 2960 m, 2890 m, 2380 s, 1680 m, 1605 m, 1465 m, 1095 s, 1020 s, 617 m, 590 m, 518 w cm−1.
