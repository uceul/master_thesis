Synthesis of [H3N(CH2)3NH3]·[Be3(HPO3)4] 1. The reactants BeO (0.025 g, 1 mmol), H3PO3 (0.410 g, 5 mmol), H3BO3 (0.305 g, 5 mmol), and 1,3-diammonium propane (0.2 mL, 2.35 mmol) were added to 2 mL (111 mmol) of distilled water. The solution pH values before and after the reaction were 2.2 and 4.6. The mixture was placed in 23-mL Teflon-lined stainless steel hydrothermal autoclaves with a filling capacity of ∼15% and heated at 160 °C for 120 h under autogenous pressure. The crystalline products were filtered, washed with deionized water, and dried at room temperature. The found data (wt %) are 6.45 for Be, 28.98 for P, 8.61 for C, 6.51 for N, and 3.78 for H, consistent with the caculated values of [H3N(CH2)3NH3]·[Be3(HPO3)4], Be:  6.39, P:  29.28, C:  8.52, N:  6.62, and H:  3.81.
