‡ Synthesis of 1: a mixture of Zn(NO3)2·6H2O (0.30 g, 1.0 mmol), H3PIMDC (0.10 g, 0.5 mmol) and 8 mL water was heated in a 23 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave at 180 °C for 5 days under static pressure, and then cooled to room temperature. The light yellow hexagonal prism crystals were obtained, washed with water and air-dried. Yield: 0.14 g (∼54% based on Zn). Anal. Calcd for C48H60N12O35Zn11 (%): C, 27.64; H, 2.88; N, 8.06.
