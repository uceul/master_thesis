Synthesis: A mixture of Zn(NO3)2·6H2O (0.2900 g, 1.0 mmol) and H2BDC‐OH (0.1840 g, 1.0 mmol) was dissolved in DMF (10 mL) solvent. Then DABCO (0.0584 g, 0.5 mmol) was added, and the mixture was transferred to a screw‐capped vial. The vial was capped and placed in an oven at 110 °C for 24 h. The colorless column single crystals were washed with DMF several times to give UTSA‐25 [Zn(BDC‐OH)(DABCO)0.5·(DMF)2(H2O); 0.298 g; yield based on Zn(NO3)2·6H2O: 66.9 %]. Elemental analysis: calcd. C 43.85, H 5.58, N 9.02; found C 43.79, H 5.23; N 9.02.
