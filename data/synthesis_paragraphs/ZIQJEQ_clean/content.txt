[Cu5(BBTZ)7(H2O)6][P2W22Cu2O77(OH)2]⋅6 H2O (4): K5.5Na1.5[PW10Cu2(H2O)2O38]⋅13 H2O (0.6 g, 0.20 mmol), Cu(NO3)2⋅6 H2O (0.177 g, 0.6 mmol), and BBTZ (0.15 g, 0.625 mmol) were mixed in distilled water (10 mL). The mixture was adjusted to pH 4.0 with 1 M HCl and stirred for 0.5 h, then the suspension was sealed into a Teflon‐lined autoclave and kept under autogenous pressure at 140 °C for 5 d before being slowly cooled to RT. Blue block crystals were filtered, washed with distilled water, and kept in a vacuum desiccator (70 % yield based on W). Selected IR (KBr pellet): =3440 (s), 3105 (w), 1643 (w), 1527 (s), 1427 (w), 1282 (s), 1211 (m), 1130 (s), 1063 (s), 960 (s), 885 (s), 806 cm−1 (s); TGA results indicate that there are approximately twelve coordinated and/or lattice water molecules in the final molecular formula of 4; elemental analysis calcd (%) for C84H110N42O91P2W22Cu7: C 13.06, H 1.43, N 7.62; found: C 13.01, H 1.48, N 7.56.
