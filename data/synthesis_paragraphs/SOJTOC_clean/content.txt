[{(H2O)2Zn(μ-TMBTA)Zn·K}·2H2O]∝TMBTA-Zn(II) was synthesized under solvothermal condition from a water–ethanol solution of a mixture of potassium salt of TMBTA (60 mg, 0.1468 mmol), ZnCl2 (57 mg, 0.42 mmol). The mixture was taken carefully in a 25 mL Teflon-coated autoclaved bomb, heated at 120 °C for 48 h, and allowed to cool slowly. After cooling, good-looking plate-shaped colorless crystals were obtained. The crystals were washed with ethanol–water and carefully characterized by SXRD, elemental analysis, PXRD, and FT-IR. Yield: ∼49% (50 mg, 0.1468 mmol). Elemental analysis calcd for C15H23KO10Zn (%): C, 38.51; H, 4.96. Found: C, 38.04; H, 4.88. FT-IR (KBr, cm–1): 3396, 3240, 1604, 1556s, 1384s, 2978brs, 1271s 1228m, 1188m, 1022m, 904m, 831m, 812m, 744m, 692s, 615m, 542m cm–1.
