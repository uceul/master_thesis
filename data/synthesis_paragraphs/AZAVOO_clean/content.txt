A 0.5 M stock solution of magnesium nitrate hexahydrate in deionized water (0.12 mL) was added to an 8 mL vial, which was preloaded with H6CPB (8 mg, 0.01 mmol). This was followed by the addition of DEF (0.40 mL), EtOH (1.50 mL), and deionized water (0.24 mL) to the vial. The reaction mixture was quickly sonicated and heated at 120 °C for 24 h, yielding colorless, block-shaped crystals. The crystals were then thoroughly washed with DMF (4 × 8 mL) per day for 4 days total. To yield guest-free material, DMF-washed MOF-889 was subsequently immersed in DCM (4 × 8 mL) per day for 4 days total. The solvent-exchanged sample was activated under vacuum at ambient temperature for 24 h, followed by heating at 180 °C under vacuum for an additional 24 h. EA.
