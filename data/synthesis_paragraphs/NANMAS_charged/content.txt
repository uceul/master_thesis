Synthesis of {[La2(oda)6Mg2][Mg(H2O)6]·6H2O}n (1): A mixture of La2O3 (0.5 mmol, 0.16 g), MgO (1.5 mmol, 0.06 g), and H2oda (3 mmol, 0.40 g) was dissolved in distilled water (8 mL) and ethanol (2 mL). The pH was adjusted to 4 with triethylamine. The resulting solution was transferred to a 25 mL Teflon‐lined stainless steel vessel, which was sealed and heated at 140 °C for 72 h. After the reactor had been cooled to room temperature at a rate of 5 °C/h, colorless cubic crystals were collected by filtration, washed with distilled water, and dried in air. Yield: 52 % based on La. C24H48La2Mg3O42 (1359.33): C 21.21, H 3.56; found C 21.24, H 3.53.
