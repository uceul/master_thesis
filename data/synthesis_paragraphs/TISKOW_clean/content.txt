A mixture of Zn(OAc)2·2H2O (0.22 g, 1.0 mmol), trz (0.11 g, 1.5 mmol), KSCN (0.049 g, 0.50 mmol), and H2O (10 mL) was heated at 180 °C for 5 days under autogenous pressure. The mixture was cooled to room temperature at a rate of 0.5 °C min−1. Pure colorless prismatic crystals were collected, washed with H2O, and air-dried (yield 0.15 g, 78% based on Zn). Anal. Calcd for C7H6N10Zn2S: C, 21.40; H, 1.54; N, 35.63. Found: C, 21.33; H, 1.59; N, 35.41%.
