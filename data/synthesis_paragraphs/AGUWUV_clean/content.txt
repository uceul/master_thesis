{[Ni3(H2O)4(ptz)2(btec)]·4H2O}n (1): NiCl2·6H2O (47.5 mg, 0.2 mmol), H4btec (25.4 mg, 0.1 mmol), 2‐cyanopyrazine (10.5 mg, 0.1 mmol), and NaN3 (13.0 mg, 0.2 mmol) were dissolved in water (10 mL) and stirred for 10 minutes. Afterwards, the resulting mixture was transferred into a parr Teflon‐lined stainless steel vessel (23 mL) and heated to 160 °C for 96 h under autogenous pressure. Green block‐shaped crystals suitable for X‐ray analysis were obtained directly, washed with ethanol, and dried in air. Yield: 56 % based on 2‐cyanopyrazine.
