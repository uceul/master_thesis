A typical synthesis recipe was as follows: 3.86 g phosphoric acid (85 wt% in water) was placed in a glass beaker. 6.16 g tetramethylammonium hydroxide pentahydrate and 1.33 g zinc oxide were successively added under stirring. For homogenization the white suspension of molar composition NMe4OH ∶ H3PO4 ∶ ZnO ∶ H2O = 2.1 ∶ 2.0 ∶ 1.0 ∶ 12.4 (pH ca. 8) was heated under continuous stirring until a viscous gel resulted. The hot gel was transferred into a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave of 8 ml volume (degree of filling 40%) and kept at 463 K under static conditions and autogenous pressure for 4 days. The white product was filtered off, washed with small amounts of deionized water and dried in a vacuum at room temperature. The mother liquor had a pH of 7.5. The crystals obtained were up to 0.3 mm in size, generally not well-faceted and apparently frequently twinned.
