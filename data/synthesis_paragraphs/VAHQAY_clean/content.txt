‡ Synthesis of 1: A mixture of Dy2O3 (0.094 g, 0.25 mmol), CuCl2·2H2O (0.042 g, 0.25 mmol), HL (0.199 g, 1 mmol) and 10 mL water was sealed in a 30 mL Teflon-lined bomb at 170 °C for 7 days, and then cooled to room temperature. Orange crystals of 1 were obtained (yield: 43% based on Dy2O3). Anal. Calc. for 1, C60H40N5O10Dy1.25Cu1.25: C 56.58, H 3.17, N 5.50. Found: C 55.83, H 3.73, N 5.03%. IR bands (cm−1) for 1: 3056w, 1937w, 1706w, 1603vs, 1589vs, 1547vs, 1519vs, 1418vs, 1217w, 1180w, 1100w, 1083m, 1066w, 853s, 828m, 784s, 761m, 705w, 664w, 556w, 489s. Synthesis of 2: A mixture of Er2O3 (0.096 g, 0.25 mmol), CuCl2·2H2O (0.042 g, 0.25 mmol), HL (0.199 g, 1 mmol) and 10 mL water was sealed in a 30 mL Teflon-lined bomb at 170 °C for 7 days, and then cooled to room temperature. Red crystals of 2 were obtained (yield: 31% based on Er2O3). Anal. Calc. for 2, C60H40N5O10Er1.25Cu1.25: C 56.32, H 3.15, N 5.47. Found: C 55.75, H 3.68, N 5.23%. IR bands (cm−1) for 2: 3067w, 1903w, 1706w, 1670w, 1603vs, 1589vs, 1546vs, 1519vs, 1420vs, 1284m, 1217m, 1179m, 1099w, 1066w, 857s, 830m, 784s, 761s, 701m, 657m, 552m, 472s.
