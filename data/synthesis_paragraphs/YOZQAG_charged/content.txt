Synthesis of UoC‐1: In a 20 mL vial, Zn(NO3)2⋅6 H2O (0.147 g, 0.49 mmol) and H2L2 (0.05 g, 0.16 mmol) were dissolved in a mixture of DMF (10 mL) and H2O (0.15 mL) at room temperature. The vial was placed in a temperature controlled oven at 95 °C. Transparent cubic‐like crystals were formed within 24 h. Yield: 0.136 g, based on Zn(NO3)2⋅6 H2O.
