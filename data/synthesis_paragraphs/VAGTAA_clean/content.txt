‡ Synthesis of [Mg(DHT)(DMF)2]n (1): A mixture of Mg(NO3)2·6H2O (0.128 g, 0.5 mmol), 2,5-dihydroxyterephthalic acid (0.099 g, 0.5 mmol) and 15 μL triethylamine and 8 mL N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) were placed in a 23 mL Teflon bomb and the whole reaction mixture was stirred for 1 h. The Teflon bomb was subsequently placed in a steel autoclave and heated at 120 °C under autogenous pressure for 72 h and then cooled to ambient temperature. Light yellow colored, block shaped crystals were isolated by decanting the supernatant liquid and were washed thoroughly several times with DMF. (Yield 80%). IR (KBr cm−1); ν(O–H), 3468; νas(OCO), 1609; νs(OCO), 1455. Anal. Calcd. for C14H18MgN2O8: C, 45.82; H, 4.90; N, 7.63. Found: C, 45.21; H, 5.01; N, 7.49%.
