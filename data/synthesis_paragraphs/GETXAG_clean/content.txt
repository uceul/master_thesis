 Co(NO3)2·6H2O (0.4 mmol, 116.4 mg), HL1 (0.3 mmol, 48.3 mg), NaOH (0.3 mL, 1 M) and H2O (4 mL) was stirred at room temperature until a homogeneous mixture was obtained. The mixture was transferred into a Teflon-lined autoclave (15 mL) and heated at 100 °C for 2 days and then cooled to room temperature under ambient conditions. Orange block crystals of 1 were recovered by filtration, washed with distilled water, and dried in air (63% yield based on HL1). Anal. Calc. for 1: C, 37.98; H, 3.19; N, 31.64. Found: C, 38.24; H, 3.30; N, 31.95%. Selected IR data (KBr pellet cm−1): 3407 (s), 1619 (s), 1578 (m), 1448 (s), 1266 (w), 1059 (s), 847 (m), 771 (m).
