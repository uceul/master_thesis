A mixture of 2-buthylimidazole (2-buim, 0.0150 g, 0.12 mmol), NH2–H3BTB (0.0180 g, 0.042 mmol), Zn(NO3)2·6H2O (0.0560 g, 0.2 mmol), tetramethylammonium bromide (0.0085 g, 0.055 mmol), and DMF/EtOH/H2O (v/v/v = 4:2:1, 7 mL) was heated in a 20 mL scintillation vial at 100 °C for 24 h, followed by cooling to room temperature. The resulting crystals were washed with DMF and water and dried in air. Anal. Calcd for [Zn2(NH2–BTB)][2-buim]·3DMF·5H2O: Calcd C, 50.69; H, 4.91; N, 8.25; found C, 48.79; H, 4.68; N, 7.73%.
