† Preparation of [K2Mg2{U2(C2O4)7}·2H2O];9H2O: K4U(C2O4)4 was synthesized in situ from U(C2O4)2·6H2O (0.2 g, 0.4 mmol) and K2(C2O4)·H2O (0.15 g, 0.8 mmol) in H2O (12 mL) at 80 °C. To the hot green solution, a solution of Mg(ClO4)2·6H2O (0.15 g, 0.4 mmol) in H2O (2 mL) was added. The reaction mixture was allowed to cool, and ethanol was added by vapor diffusion. After 7 days green crystals were obtained that were manually separated from precipitated white magnesium oxalate and light-green uranium oxalate. Anal.

Crystal data: C14H22O39K2Mg2U2, Mr = 1417.20 g mol−1, crystal dimension 0.34 × 0.30 × 0.20 mm3, monoclinic, space group C2/m, a = 20.437(3) Å, b = 12.841(4) Å, c = 14.614(5) Å, β = 94.52(6)°, V = 3823.4(1) Å3, Z = 4, ρcalcd. = 2.462 g cm−3, F(000) = 2656, μ(MoKα) = 8.838 mm−1, T = 298 K, 2θmax = 72.6°. A total of 22286 reflections were collected in the range of 4.1° ≤ θ ≤ 36.3° of which 9529 were unique reflections and 6805 with (I > 4σ(I)) were collected for the analysis. The H atoms have been included in theoretical positions but not refined. The final indices were R1 = 0.052, Rw2 = 0.142 with S = 1.082. CCDC 246085.
