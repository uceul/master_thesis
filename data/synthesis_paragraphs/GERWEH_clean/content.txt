A mixture of Cu(NO3)2·4H2O (0.012 g, 0.05 mmol) and H8L (0.0138 g, 0.02 mmol) in 4 mL of H2O, 2 mL of DMF and a drop of HCl (6 mol/L) was sealed in an autoclave equipped with a Teflon linear (25 mL), heated at 70 °C for 3 days, and then cooled to room temperature. Blue rod single crystals of 1 were collected in a ca. 30% yield based on H8L. Elemental analysis for C38H54SiCu4O32N2, calcd (%): C, 34.24; H, 4.08; N, 2.10. Found (%): C, 34.17; H, 4.00; N, 2.17.
