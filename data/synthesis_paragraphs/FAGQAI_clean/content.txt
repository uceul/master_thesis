Preparation of [Cu3(BTEB)2(H2O)2(DMF)] (TCM‐10): To a solution of 0.065 g of Cu(NO3)2·3H2O in DMF (2 mL), was added BTEB (0.094 g). The resulting mixture was sonicated for 10 min. Then, a solution of 4,4′‐bipyridine (0.015 g) in DMF (0.25 mL) was added to this mixture. The resulting reaction mixture was kept in a closed vial at 85 °C in an oven for 48 h. A mixture containing light‐blue, plate‐like crystals (TCM‐8), greenish‐blue, polyhedron‐type crystals (TCM‐4), and aggregates of blue, block‐like crystals (TCM‐10) was obtained. The latter crystals of TCM‐10 are distinguishable from the other crystals by their color and morphology. TCM‐10 was isolated from the mixture manually. Yield: 5–10 %. Dried sample of TCM‐10 (C69H41Cu3NO15) with four constitutional H2O molecules per formula unit: calcd. C 59.76, H 3.56, N 1.01; found C 59.76, H 3.39, N 1.40.
