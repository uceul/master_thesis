 A mixture of H3PMo12O40·13H2O (0.6178 g, 0.3 mmol), CuCl2·2H2O (0.1372 g, 0.8 mmol), pz (0.0520 g, 0.4 mmol) and H2O (18 mL) was stirred for 30 min in air until it was homogeneous. When the pH value of the mixture was adjusted to about 3.5 with 1 M HCl, the solution was transferred and sealed in a 30 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave, which was heated at 160 °C under autogenous pressure for 4 days. The dark block crystals were isolated and collected by filtration, washed thoroughly with distilled water, and dried at room temperature (58% yield based on Cu). Anal. C28H32Cu4Mo12N14O42P (2673.10): C 12.26 (calcd 12.57); H 0.94 (1.20); Cu 0.17 (0.10); Mo 0.58 (0.43); N 7.58 (7.33); P 0.08 (0.01) wt%.
