Synthesis of compound 1: a mixture of 0.5 mmol Zn(NO3)2·6H2O, 0.5 mmol 5,5′-(1,4-phenylene)bis(1H-tetrazole) (H2BDT), 1 mmol 1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylic acid (H3BTC) in 4 mL N, N′-dimethylformamide (DMF) and 1 mL ethanol were sealed in a 20 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave, heated at 160 °C for 5 days under autogenous pressure. After the autoclave was cooled to room temperature, the products were washed by ethanol and air-dried, then the light yellow crystals were obtained (yield: 45%, based on Zn). Anal. Calc. for 1, C40H56O14N14Zn2: C, 44.17%; H, 5.19%; N, 18.03%. Found: C, 44.11%; H, 5.29%; N, 17.95%.
