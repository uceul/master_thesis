A mixture of Dy(NO3)3·5H2O (438 mg, 1 mmol), 1,3-benzenedicarboxyllic acid (166 mg, 1 mmol), 1,10-phenanthroline (198 mg, 1 mmol), DMF (5.0 mL), distilled water (1.5 mL), and ethanol (1.0 mL) was stirred for 30 min, and the final pH is at ca. 6.5. The final straw yellow mixture was then sealed in a 15 mL Teflon-lined reactor and heated at 85 °C for 2 day. After being slowly cooled to room temperature, colorless well-shaped single crystals of coordination polymer 1 suitable for X-ray diffraction analysis were obtained (yield ca. 97%, based on 1,3-H2BDC). Coordination polymer 1 is not soluble in common solvents, such as H2O, CH3CH2OH, CHCl3, DMSO or DMF. Elemental analysis for 1: C68H44Dy3N7O21 (Mr: 1782.60). Calcd: C, 45.82; N, 5.50; H, 2.49%. Found: C, 45.52; N, 5.32; H, 2.29%. IR (KBr, cm−1): 3421 (s), 1641 (vs), 1543 (vs), 1480 (s), 1448 (s), 1393 (vs), 1299 (w), 1141 (w), 1103 (w), 845 (m), 826 (w), 731 (m), 705 (w), 656 (w), 572 (w), 432 (m), 419 (m).
