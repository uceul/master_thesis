 HL1 (0.1 mmol, 19.9 mg), Cd(NO3)2·4H2O (0.1 mmol, 30.8 mg), and KOH (0.025–0.1 mmol, 14–56 mg) were dissolved in DMF (5 mL) and one drop of 6N HNO3 was added. The resulting reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature for 30 min. Then the 20 mL reaction vial was placed in an oven and heated at 80 °C for two days. After this time octahedral colorless crystals of 1 were obtained in 60% yield, IR (KBr 4000–400 cm−1) 3400 (w), 3088 (w), 2930 (w), 1670 (s), 1609 (s), 1559 (s), 1506 (s), 1436 (w), 1393 (s), 1093 (m), 1049 (w), 882 (m), 838 (m), 773 (s), 738 (w), 680 (s), 623 (m). Elemental analysis (%): Calcd for: C84H83Cd3 KN10O20: C 52.3 H 4.3 N 7.26; found: C 51.7 H 4.04 N 7.2.
