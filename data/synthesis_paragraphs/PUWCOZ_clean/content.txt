Ni2(ATC)(H2O)4·(H2O)4, MOF-34. H4ATC (0.032 g, 0.10 mmol), Ni(NO3)2·6H2O (0.070 g, 0.24 mmol), H2O (1 mL), and aqueous NaOH solution (1 mL, 0.1 mmol) were added respectively to a vessel, which was sealed and heated to 180 °C at a rate of 5 °C/min for 40 h and then cooled to room temperature at a rate of 2 °C/min. Needle-shaped green crystals of the product were formed and collected by filtration, yielding 0.016 g (27% yield based on H4ATC). The product is stable in air and insoluble in water and common organic solvents such as ethanol, acetonitrile, acetone, chloroform, and DMF. Anal. Calcd for C14H28O16Ni2 = MOF-34:  C, 29.51; H, 4.95. Found:  C, 29.69; H, 4.70. FT-IR (KBr, 4000−400 cm-1):  3428 (br), 2948 (w), 1611 (s), 1519 (s), 1414 (m), 1355 (m), 1229 (w), 1124 (w), 723 (m), 571 (w).
