 A solution of 3H2 (0.101 g, 0.182 mmol) and Zn(NO3)2·6H2O (0.159 g, 0.535 mmol) in DMF (10 mL) was prepared and transferred to a 23 mL Teflon-lined autoclave. The reaction vessel was sealed and heated to 110 °C for 72 h. Programmed cooling (0.1 °C min−1 from 110 °C to 25 °C) afforded clear, colourless crystalline solids (0.065 g, 46%). Single crystals suitable for X-ray diffraction were isolated and used in structural elucidation of TMOF-3. Confirmation of structure uniformity throughout the bulk sample was performed using PXRD. IR (cm−1) 2904, 1646, 1607, 1557, 1487, 1405, 1229, 1113, 1070, 1017, 853, 744, 718; EA calcd for Zn2(HN(CH3)2)2(3)2·2CH2Cl2·3H2O: C, 60.44%, N, 1.81%, H, 4.68%. Found: C, 60.42%, N, 1.68%, H, 4.15%. (Analysis was obtained after solvent extraction procedure.)
