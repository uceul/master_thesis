A mixture of ImhedpH4 (0.10 mmol, 0.0272 g) and CoSO4·7H2O (0.15 mmol, 0.0421 g) in 6 mL of H2O, adjusted to a pH of 4.00 with 1 M NaOH, was kept in a Teflon-lined autoclave at 180 °C for 5 days. After the mixture was cooled to room temperature, pink needlelike crystals were obtained as a monophasic material based on the powder XRD patterns. Yield: 31 mg (75.6%). Anal. found (calcd) for C10H26Co3N4O20P4: C, 14.75 (14.59); H, 3.27 (3.18); N, 7.08 (6.81)%. IR (KBr, cm−1): 3555−3290(m, br), 3196−3039(w, br), 2762(w), 1655(w), 1506(w), 1446(m), 1405(w), 1288(w), 1246(w), 1222(w), 1186(s), 1088(s), 1050(m), 1030(m), 1004(m), 943(w), 890(m), 865(m), 844(w), 795(w), 763(w), 684(w), 662(w), 550(m), 508(w), 470(w), 427(w). Thermal analysis revealed a weight loss of 8.8% over the temperature range 25−165 °C, which corresponds to two lattice and two coordination water molecules (calcd. 8.7%). The remaining two coordination waters were removed between 220 and 342 °C (obsd. 4.3%, calcd. 4.4%), followed immediately by the decomposition of the organic ligand and the collapse of the structure.
