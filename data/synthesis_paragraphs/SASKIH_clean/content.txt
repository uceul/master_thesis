In a typical synthesis for [C2N2H10] · [(VO)3(H2O)(HPO3)4] · H2O, 0.091 g (0.5 mmol) of vanadium oxide (V2O5) were dissolved in 5.0 mL (166 mmol) of water, and then 0.410 g (5 mmol) of phosphorous acid (H3PO3) and 0.30 mL (4.5 mmol) of ethylenediamine (C2N2H8) were added on stirring to form a mixture with a molar ratio of 1.0V2O5 : 10.0H3PO3 : 9.0en : 232 H2O. After stirred for 30 min, the final reaction mixture with pH = 6.0 was transferred in a sealed Teflon-lined steel autoclave and heated at 160 °C for 120 h. The resulting green block crystals were filtered, washed with distilled water and dried under ambient conditions. The yield of product was 70% in weight based on vanadium.
