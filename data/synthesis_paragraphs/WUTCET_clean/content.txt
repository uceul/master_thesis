Synthesis of ℝPM‐1: In a typical synthesis, [Co(bpdc)(H2O)2]⋅H2O (0.3 mmol, white‐gray), prepared as previously reported8, and bpy (0.1 mmol) were stirred in DMF (10 mL) and well mixed. The solution was then transferred into an acid digestion bomb, which was closed and heated at 150 °C for 3 days, giving rise to deep‐purple columnar crystals of ℝPM‐1 in high yield (129.1 mg, ≈94.5 %). ℝPM‐1 can also be synthesized solvothermally by direct reaction of Co(NO3)2⋅6 H2O with bpy and bpdc in a DMF solution at 150 °C for three days. A 13.5 mg of the ground product was immersed in distilled water for 30 min, yielding [Co(bpdc)(H2O)2]⋅H2O in quantitative yield (10.4 mg, calcd 10.5 mg). Powder X‐ray diffraction (PXRD) analysis of the product was in excellent agreement with the calculated PXRD pattern produced by single crystal data.
