H8TIAPy (5 mg, 0.0058 mmol), Eu(NO3)3 (15 mg, 0.0444 mmol), DMF (5 mL), H2O (0.7 mL), and concentrated HNO3 (0.3 mL) were combined in a 20 mL glass vial, sealed, and heated at 85 °C for 24 h and then cooled to room temperature. Yellow block crystals were collected and air-dried (yield: 80%, based on H8TIAPy). Elemental and ICP analysis for Eu2(H2TIAPy)·(H2O)4 = C48H28O20Eu2 calcd (%): C, 46.91; H, 2.28; Eu, 50.81. Found (%): C, 47.02; H, 2.11; Eu, 50.87.
