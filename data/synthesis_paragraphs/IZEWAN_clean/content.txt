 Zn(OAc)2·2H2O (22 mg) and H6L (8 mg) were mixed with 2 ml of 1,4-dioxane/H2O (4:1) in a glass container and tightly capped with a Teflon vial and heated at 100 °C for two days. After cooling to room temperature, colourless and rod shaped crystals were obtained. Yield: ∼70% (based on the ligand). The sample was subjected to solvent evacuation at 150 °C, for 10 h and 10−3 Torr, giving rise to the anhydrous sample.
