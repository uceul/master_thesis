A mixture of NdCl3·6H2O (0.01 mmol), H3L (0.005 mmol), and K2CO3 (0.005 mmol) was placed in a small vial containing THF (1.0 mL), DMF (0.5 mL), and EtOH (0.5 mL). The vial was sealed, heated at 80 °C for two days, and allowed to cool to room temperature. The purple crystals of 1 suitable for XRD were collected by filtration, washed with diethyl ether, and dried in air. Compound 2 was synthesized in a similar procedure by using La(NO3)3·6H2O. The single-crystal diffraction showed that the products have the formula (Me2NH2)2[Nd4(CO3)L4(DMF)2(H2O)2]·2H2O (1) and (Me2NH2)2[La4(CO3)L4(DMF)4 (H2O)2]·2H2O (2), while microanalysis and TGA indicated that they partially lost guest molecules upon exposure to air.
