Synthesis of 1: It was prepared from a mixture of DyCl3Â·6H2O (0.1 mmol, 38 mg), H2TPPS (0.1 mmol, 94 mg), 10 mL distilled water in a 25 mL Teflon-lined autoclave under autogenous pressure at 473 K for ten days. After cooling to room temperature, purple block crystals were collected by filtration and washed with distilled water in 33% yield (based on dysprosium). m/z (MALDI-TOF-MS in CHCl3 (matrix: CHCA)) 1093.46 (Dy(H2TPPS) requires 1093.97) (Fig. S5).
