All compounds including the mixed-lanthanide ones were obtained by adopting an otherwise identical procedure except for the different starting lanthanide salts. The synthesis of [La(BTPCA)H2O]·2DMF·3H2O (La-BTPCA) is thus presented here in detail as a representative: A mixture containing LaCl3·6H2O (71 mg, 0.20 mmol), H3BTPCA (93 mg, 0.2 mmol), dimethylformamide (DMF, 10 mL), and H2O (10 mL) was stirred at room temperature for 1 h and then at 65 °C (oil bath) for 72 h. The product was isolated as colorless needle-like crystals upon cooling of the reaction mixture, collected by filtration, washed with DMF and deionized water, and dried under vacuum (yield 0.118 g, 72% based on La).
