Cd(NO3)2⋅4 H2O (30.8 mg, 0.1 mmol), H5L (10.2 mg, 0.02 mmol), DMAc/H2O (1.5/1 mL) (DMAc=N,N′‐dimethylacetamide) were mixed in a Teflon‐lined stainless steel vessel (23 mL). The mixture was heated under autogenous pressure at 90 °C for 72 h, and then cooled to RT. Colorless platelet crystals that were suitable for single‐crystal X‐ray analysis were obtained by filtration. The resulting colorless block crystals were washed with DMAc (yield: 69 % based on cadmium) and has a formula of {[Cd5(L)2(H2O)4(DMAc)3]⋅10 H2O⋅7 DMAc}n, which was derived from crystallographic data, elemental analysis (calcd: C, 40.09; H, 5.38; N, 5.19; found: C, 39.78; H, 4.99; N, 5.42 %.), and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA, Figure S8, Supporting Information).
