 The intermediate hexakis(bromomethyl)benzene and H12L were prepared according to the procedures reported previously. A mixture of MnCl2·4H2O (0.020 g, 0.1 mmol), H12L (0.021 g, 0.017 mmol) and DEF (8 mL) was placed in a 15 mL Teflon reactor and kept under autogenous pressure at 80 °C for three days. Then, the mixture was cooled to room temperature, and the light yellow crystals were obtained with a 45% yield. Anal. calcd for C88H112Mn6N6O42 (Mr = 2255.48): C, 46.86; H, 5.01; N, 3.73.
