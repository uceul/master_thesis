Synthesis of Ln‐MOF 1⋅n DMF: A mixture of Tb(NO3)3⋅6 H2O (0.0453 g, 0.1 mmol), H2FDA (0.0312 g, 0.2 mmol), and DMF (2 mL) was stirred for 10 min and then sealed in a 25 mL Teflon‐lined autoclave, which was heated at 120 °C for 21 h. The reaction vessel was then removed from the oven and allowed to cool to room temperature. Colorless ribbon crystals of 1⋅n DMF (49 % yield based on Tb) were collected after they had been washed with DMF and dried in air. IR (KBr): =3328 (br), 1611 (s), 1397 (s), 1104 (m), 1018 (m), 968 (m), 786 (s), 507 cm−1 (m); elemental analysis calcd (%) for C27H27Tb2N3O18: C 32.44, H 2.72, N 4.20; found: C 32.96, H 2.79, N 4.61.
