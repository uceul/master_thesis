 An aqueous mixture (10.0 mL) containing H2pdc (0.2500 mmol, 41.75 mg), Na2MoO4·2H2O (0.2500 mmol, 60.40 mg), Na2SiO3·9H2O (0.2500 mmol, 71.00 mg) and Sm2O3 (0.1250 mmol, 43.60 mg), with a starting pH of 2.0 adjusted with 1.0 mol L−1 HNO3, was sealed in a 23.0 mL Parr Teflon-lined stainless steel auto-clave, heated to 380 K in an oven for 2 d, and finally cooled naturally to room temperature. Yellow block crystals were obtained in 30% yield (based on Mo). Anal. calcd (%) for C28H48Mo12N4O74SiSm4 (Mr = 3405.52): C, 9.87; H, 1.41; N, 1.65; Mo, 33.8%. Found (%): C, 9.92; H, 1.38; N, 1.81; Mo, 32.3%.
