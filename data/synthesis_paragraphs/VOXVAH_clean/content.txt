 A mixture of BeSO4·4H2O (0.177 g), H3PO4 (0.230 g, 85 wt%), 4,4′-bipyridine (0.156 g), and ethanol (8.0 mL) was sealed in a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave and heated at 180 °C for 9 days. The autoclave was subsequently allowed to cool to room temperature. Colorless crystals were recovered by filtration, washed with distilled water, and finally dried at ambient temperature (87.4% yield based on beryllium). IR (KBr pellets, cm−1): 3130(w), 3170(w), 1640(m), 1560(w), 1500(w), 1450(w), 1110(s), 829(w), 708(m), 494(m).
