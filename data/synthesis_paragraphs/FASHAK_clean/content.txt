Synthesis of 1: A mixture of Pr(NO3)3·6H2O (0.1310 g, 0.3 mmol), Na2CO3 (0.05 g, 0.5 mmol), P-4mo-BDCME (0.0546 g, 0.3 mmol) and H2O (15 ml) was sealed in a 23 ml Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave and was heated at 160 °C for 72 h in a programmable oven. Then, the reactor was cooled slowly to room temperature at a rate of 0.5 °C/min. The brown crystals were filtered out and washed with water and ethanol, respectively (yield: 65%).
