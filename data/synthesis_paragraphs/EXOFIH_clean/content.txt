 [H3O][In(btec)]·0.8H2O (1). The mixture of InCl3·4H2O (0.2 mmol, 0.059 g), H4btec (0.3 mmol, 0.076 g), DMA (3 mL) (DMA = N,N′-dimethyl acetamide), C2H5OH (2 mL), piperazine (0.1 mL, 0.9 mol L−1 in DMF) and HNO3 (0.28 mL, 0.7 mol L−1 in DMF) was added to a 23 mL teflon reactor and stirred for 20 min in air. Then the reaction system was heated at 358 K for 21 h and warmed up to 378 K for 36 h, followed by cooling to room temperature at a rate of 5 K h−1. The resulting red block crystals of 1 were obtained. (30% yield, based on InCl3). Elemental analysis (%) calcd. for C10H6.6InO9.81: C, 30.15; H, 1.67. Found: C, 30.38; H, 1.78.
