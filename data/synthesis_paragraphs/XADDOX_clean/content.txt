[Co6(μ3‐OH)2(ipa)5(H2O)5]·8H2O (1): Solvothermal reaction of a mixture of Co(OAc)2·5H2O (0.060 g, 0.25 mmol), H2ipa (0.066 g, 0.40 mmol), and methanol (5 mL) in a 10 mL Teflon‐lined bomb at 160 °C for 3 d afforded red block crystals of 1 (yield ca. 65 %). Compound 1 can be also obtained with adding LiOH (0.023 g, 1.0 mmol) in the above reaction system. C40H48Co6O35 (1442.36): C 33.31, H 3.35; found C 33.36, H 3.38. FTIR (KBr):  = 3410 (m), 1610 (s), 1546 (m), 1481 (m), 1386 (s), 1078 (w), 747 (m), 715 (m) cm–1.
