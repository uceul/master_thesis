H2TCPP (90 mg, 0.11 mmol) and FeCl3·6H2O (90 mg, 0.33 mmol) were dissolved in 10 mL of DMF in a 45 mL Teflon-lined reactor. Pyrazine was added to the reaction mixture (20 mg, 0.25 mmol), and the solution was stirred for 5 min at room temperature. The reactor was then transferred in a programmable oven at 180 °C for 15 h (heating rate 0.5 °C/min, cooling rate 0.8 °C/min). The crystalline solid obtained was filtered under a vacuum and washed with DMF and acetone until the filtrate solution became clear; 110 mg of material was obtained.
