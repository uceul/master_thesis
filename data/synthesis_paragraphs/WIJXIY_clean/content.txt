A mixture of Zn(NO3)2·6H2O (0.60 mmol, 0.15 g) and 2,7-H2CDC (0.10 mmol, 0.026 g) was dissolved in DEF (3.0 mL) in a glass vial (25 ml), heated at 85 °C for 16 h, and then cooled to room temperature. A few yellow cubic crystals of 1 and a large amount of uncharacterized powder were obtained. The crystals were manually sorted out for crystallographic and IR measurements. Our efforts to obtain a pure phase of 1 turned out in vain. IR (KBr, cm−1): 3257 m, 2979 s, 1652vs, 1598 s, 1553 m, 1508 m, 1328 m, 1266 w, 1219 w, 1118 w, 775 s.
