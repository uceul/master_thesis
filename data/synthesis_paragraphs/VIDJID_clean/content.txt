 A mixture of Hcpt (5.3 mg, 0.028 mmol) and Co(NO3)2·6H2O (220 mg, 0.75 mmol) was placed in a scintillation vial (20 mL) along with a mixture of solvents composed of DMF (10 mL), EtOH (99%, 3 mL) and water (0.3 mL). The vial was kept at 90 °C for 24 hours and upon slow cooling orange-red block shaped crystals were obtained in a vivid pink solution. Yield: 18%.
