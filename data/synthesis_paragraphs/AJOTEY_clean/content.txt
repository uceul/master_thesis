(CN3H6)2·(VO)3(H2O)3(HPO3)4·3H2O was prepared by combining 0.5 g H3PO3, 1.14 g VOSO4·nH2O and 0.71 g guanidinium carbonate in 10 ml water contained in a PTFE bottle, resulting in a deep blue solution (starting guanidine:V:P ratio ≈1:1:2). After CO2 evolution ceased, the bottle was sealed and the reactants were heated to 90 °C for two days. During this time, a small quantity of transparent, sky-blue crystals formed. The solid product was recovered from the supernatant liquors by vacuum filtration and rinsing with water and acetone. Similar reactions starting from a stoichiometric guanidine:V:P ratio of 2:3:4 led to as-yet unidentified products.
