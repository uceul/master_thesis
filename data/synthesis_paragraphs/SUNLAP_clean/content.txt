3: A mixture of (R)‐H4L (20 mg, 0.024 mmol) and Cu(NO3)2⋅2.5 H2O (40 mg, 0.17 mmol) was dissolved in a solvent mixture of dmf/H2O (3 mL/1 mL). Aqueous NH3 (3 m, 0.6 mL) was then added. The resulting solution was divided into 10 small screw‐capped vials, which were then capped and place in an oven at 80 °C for 2 weeks. Blue elongated octahedral crystals were obtained (16.5 mg, 42 % yield) after combining the crystals in all of these vials. Solvent content calcd: dmf, 36.8 %; H2O, 5.7 %; determined by 1H NMR spectroscopy and TGA: dmf, 35.6 %; H2O, 5.8 %.
