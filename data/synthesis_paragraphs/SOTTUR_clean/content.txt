A mixture of Sr(NO3)2 (0.6 mmol), H4L (0.4 mmol) and 2 ml EtOH in 10 ml distilled water, with its pH value adjusted to about 5.0 by the addition of 1 M NaOH solution, was put into a Parr Teflon-lined autoclave (23 ml) and heated at 150 °C for 4 days. The final pH value was about 4.2. Colorless block-shaped crystals of 1 were collected in a ca. 62% yield based on Sr. Its purity has also been confirmed by XRD powder diffraction (see Supporting Information). Anal.
