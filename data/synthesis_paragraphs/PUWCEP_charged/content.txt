Cd(ATC)·[Cd(H2O)6](H2O)5, MOF-32. H4ATC (0.048 g, 0.15 mmol), Cd(NO3)2·4H2O (0.120 g, 0.39 mmol), and aqueous NaOH solution (3 mL, 6 × 10-4 mmol) were added respectively to a vessel, which was sealed and heated to 180 °C at a rate of 5 °C/min for 60 h and then cooled to room-temperature at a rate of 2 °C/min. Octahedral colorless crystals of the product were formed and collected by filtration, yielding 0.10 g (91% yield based on H4ATC). The product is stable in air and insoluble in water and common organic solvents such as ethanol, acetonitrile, acetone, chloroform, and DMF. Anal. Calcd for C14H34O19Cd2 = MOF-33:  C, 23.00; H, 4.65. Found:  C, 22.99; H, 4.50. FT-IR (KBr, 4000−400 cm-1):  3468 (br, s), 2954 (w), 1710 (w), 1559 (s), 1401 (m), 1348 (m), 1216 (w), 1118 (w), 723 (m).
