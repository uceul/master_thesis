Synthesis of [Mn2L2(H2O)2]⋅3 H2O (1): Ligand H2L (10 mg, 0.037 mmol) and MnCl2⋅4 H2O (20 mg, 0.10 mmol) were dissolved in a mixture of DMF (10 mL) and H2O (16 mL). After the resulting yellow solution was heated at 80 °C for ten days, brown crystals were filtered, washed with DMF, H2O, and EtOH, and dried at RT (yield: 6.0 mg; 44.2 %, based on H2L). IR (KBr pellet): =1608 s, 1560 s, 1449 s, 1424 m, 1387 s, 1293 w, 1253 w, 1224 w, 1205 w, 1015 m, 964 m, 870 w, 814 m, 781 m, 731 s, 547 cm−1 m; elemental analysis calcd. (%) for 1: C 49.06, H 3.84, N 3.81; found: C 48.30, H 3.82, N 3.82.
