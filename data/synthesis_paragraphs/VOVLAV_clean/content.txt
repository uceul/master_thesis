[(UO2)2(H2O)(btca)]·4H2O (3). 1.0 mL of uranyl nitrate solution (0.5 M), 2 mL of sodium alendronate solution (0.05 M), 1.5 mL of Li4btca solution (0.25 M) and 3.0 ml of DI water were added in a 120 mL Teflon container, sealed inside a stainless steel pressure vessel and left in a 180 °C oven for 72 h. Yellow long needle-type crystalline product of 3 was formed after slow cooling (5 °C/h) to room temperature. The yield is ~60% based on uranium content. C10H14O18U2 (FW=898.26): calcd. C, 13.37; H, 1.57; found: C, 13.45; H, 1.46.
