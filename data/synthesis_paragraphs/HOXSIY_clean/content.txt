A mixture of Zn(NO3)2·6H2O (0.2 mmol, 0.060 g), H3BPT (0.1 mmol, 0.026 g), DMA (3 mL), and H2O (2 mL) was sealed in a small vial, which was kept at 100 °C for 60 h and finally cooled to the room temperature slowly. Colorless prism crystals yield in 43 % based on H3BPT. C34H31NO17Zn3: calcd. C 44.26; N 1.52; H 3.36 %; found C 44.23; N 1.48; H 3.35 %.
