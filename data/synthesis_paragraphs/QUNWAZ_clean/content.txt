 A solution of 22H (0.0487 g, 0.0678 mmol), 4,4′-bipyridine (0.0135 g, 0.086 mmol), and Zn(NO3)2·6H2O (0.0679 g, 0.228 mmol) in DMF (5 mL) and chlorobenzene (5 mL) was prepared and transferred to a 23 mL Teflon-lined autoclave by filtering the solution through a puck of celite. The reaction vessel was sealed and heated to 110 °C for 72 hours. Programmed cooling (0.1 °C min−1 from 110 °C to 25 °C) afforded a clear, yellow solution containing a crystalline yellow solid, which was which was collected by vacuum filtration, washed with DMF and dried to give PMOF-3.
