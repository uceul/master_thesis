A mixture of Cu(NO3)2·3H2O (72.4 mg, 3 mmol), H3L (72.5 mg, 2 mmol), DABCO (22.4 mg, 2 mmol), concentrated hydrochloric acid (150 μL), DMF (8 mL), dioxane (2 mL), and H2O (2 mL) was treated by ultrasonic vibration and then sealed into a Teflon-lined stainless steel container and heated at 358 K for 3 days. After cooling to room temperature, blue-green block crystals were obtained in 90% yield (based on H3L). Anal. Calcd for C75H129N11O37Cu3: C, 45.78; H, 6.61; N, 7.83. Found: C, 45.75; H, 6.54; N, 7.80. IR (KBr pellet, cm–1): 3441 (s), 2361 (w), 1655(s), 1618 (s), 1397 (s), 1181 (w), 1122 (w), 1015(w), 859 (w), 777 (m), 752 (w), 668 (w).
