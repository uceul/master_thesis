 Anhydrous MnCl2 (398 mg, 3.16 mmol) and H4L1·6.5H2O (225 mg, 0.27 mmol), were dissolved in a mixture of DMF (22.5 mL) and MeOH (22.5 mL) inside a 50 mL glass vial sealed with a Teflon lined screw cap. The solution was heated for 8 days at 70 °C. Large spherical polycrystalline conglomerates of almost colorless crystals were deposited starting from the second day of heating. The supernatant, containing a minor amount of non-crystalline deposit, was decanted and the crystalline precipitate was quickly transferred into a Schlenk funnel with a frit for the subsequent washing and filtration operations under inert gas. Some remaining non-crystalline admixtures were separated by suspending the crystalline precipitate multiple times in a 1:1 mixture of DMF:MeOH and removing the supernatant with a Pasteur pipette followed by double rinsing of the deposit with the same solvent mixture and suction filtration. Subsequent overnight drying in vacuo (10−2 Torr) at r.t. yielded 312 mg (85% based on H4L1·6.5H2O) of almost colorless crystalline product.
