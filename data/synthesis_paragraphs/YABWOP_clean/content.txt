Vanadium(V) oxide (0.183 g, 0.97 mmol) was dissolved in HF (1 mL, 29.0 mmol) and stirred for 5 min before methylene diphosphonic acid (0.16 g, 0.909 mmol), tris(2-aminoethyl)amine (500 μL, 3.34 mmol), H2O (5 mL, 278 mmol), and ethylene glycol (5 mL, 89.6 mmol) were added. The solution of mole ratio 1:29.8:0.93:3.4:286.5:92.4, respectively, was stirred briefly before heating to 170 °C for 24 h. The initial and final pH values were 3 and 3, respectively. Blue blocks suitable for X-ray diffraction were isolated in 85% yield. Anal. Calc. for C14H54F6N9O16P4V3: C, 16.9; H, 5.43; N, 12.7; F, 11.5. Found: C, 16.7; H, 5.16; N, 11.9; F, 11.4%.
