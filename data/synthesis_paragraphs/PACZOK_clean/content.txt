A mixture of V2O5 (0.3025 g), Zr(NO3)4·5H2O (0.7156 g), 1,6‐hexanediamine (0.7746 g), and H2O (9 mL) in molar ratio 1:1:4:100 was stirred for 2 h briefly in air, then was neutralized to pH = 4 with 50 % H3PO4. This mixture was then transferred to a 20 mL Teflon‐lined autoclave and heated to 170 °C for 6 days. After cooling to room temperature, dark octahedral crystals were isolated mechanically, washed with water, and dried at ambient temperature (0.16 g, yield 31 % based on vanadium). In addition, without the addition of Zr(NO3)4 compound 1 can be obtained as powder. The elemental analysis: found C 9.40 %, H 3.40 %, N 3.69 % (calcd. C 9.28 %, H 3.31 %, N 3.61 % ).
