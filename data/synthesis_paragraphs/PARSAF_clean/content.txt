In(NO3)3·4.5H2O (78.7 mg), CaCl2 (22.6 mg), H3BTC (42.4 mg), and N(n-C4H9)4Cl (28.7 mg) were dissolved in 8 mL of DMF in a 20 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave, and then the resulting solution was stirred for about 0.5 h at room temperature and heated at 100 °C for 5 days under autogenous pressure. After the mixture was cooled naturally to room temperature, white block crystals were obtained after being washed 3 times with 5 mL of fresh DMF. Yield: 75% (based on H3BTC).
