 A mixture of Co(NO3)2·6H2O (0.5 mmol, 0.146 g), 1,2,4,5-benzene tetracarboxylic dianhydride (BTD) (0.2 mmol, 0.044 g), dimethylacetamide DMA (3 mL), and H2O (2 mL) was heated at 85 °C for 48 h in a 20 mL sealed Teflon-lined stainless steel vessel. After the autoclave was cooled over a period of 11 h at a rate of 5 °C h−1, purple block-shaped crystals of 1 were isolated by filtration, washed with water, and dried in air. Yield: 0.037 g, 31% base on Co. Anal. calcd for C14H13NO10Co2: C, 35.54; H, 2.77; N, 2.96%. Found: C, 35.41; H, 2.85; N, 2.84%. IR data (Fig. S1a; KBr, cm−1): 3432s, 2927w, 1615s, 1496m, 1391s, 1118w, 1031w, 879m, 835w, 770w, 594m, 556w, 478m.
