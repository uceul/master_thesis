PDEB (11.33 mg, 0.025 mmol) and CuCl2·2H2O (17 mg, 0.1 mmol) in 2 mL of N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) with 0.1 mL of water and 50 μL of HBF4 were stirred for a few minutes in air, and the clear solution was transferred into a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave (20 mL). The autoclave was sealed and heated to 65 °C for 3 days and then cooled to room temperature at a rate 5 °C·h–1. Pale-green block crystals of NJU-Bai12 were obtained and then filtered and washed by DMF to yield 11.2 mg (yield: 73% based on the ligand). The crystals of NJU-Bai12 are stable for common organic solvents except for water; they become opaque after exposure to air for several minutes. Satisfactory microanalysis cannot be obtained because the extent of solvent molecules in the cavity may vary from exposure of the sample to air. Selected IR (KBr, cm–1): 3412 (br, s), 1667 (vs), 1551 (s), 1516 (m), 1406 (s), 1362 (m), 1280 (m), 1242 (m), 1106 (m), 826 (m), 760 (w), 720 (w), 600 (w).
