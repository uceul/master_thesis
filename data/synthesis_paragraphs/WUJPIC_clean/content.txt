 A mixture of Co(NO3)2·6H2O (43.6 mg, 0.15 mmol), H2L (36.4 mg, 0.15 mmol), and NaOH (12 mg, 0.3 mmol) dissolved in DMA (10 mL) and MeOH (2.5 mL) was heated at 160 °C for 96 hours. After cooling the reaction system to RT at a rate of 5 °C h−1, purple block crystals of BUT-51 (22.3 mg, 17% yield based on H2L) were harvested, and then thoroughly washed with DMA. The as-synthesized material was determined to be insoluble in common organic solvents, such as DMSO, DMA, DMF, and acetone. IR (KBr, cm−1): 3399(m), 2967(w), 2257(m), 1619(s), 1573(s), 1445(w), 1358(s), 1296(w), 1221(w), 1109(w), 1076(w), 1026(w), 939(m), 840(w) 777(s), 723(s), and 640(s). The thermal stability and phase purity of the as-synthesized BUT-51 were checked by TGA (Fig. S2) and PXRD (Fig. 2a), respectively.
