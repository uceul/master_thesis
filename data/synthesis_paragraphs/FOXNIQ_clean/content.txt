Gd(NO3)3·6H2O (0.23 g, 0.5 mmol), CoCl2·6H2O (0.12 g, 0.5 mmol), H2pydc (0.17 g, 1 mmol), and triethylamine (0.03 g, 0.3 mmol) were added to water (10 g, 556 mmol). The mixture was added to a 15 mL Teflon-lined autoclave in argon atmosphere. After heating at 443 K for three days and then cooling to room temperature in air, blue block-like crystals of compound 1 could be isolated in ∼60% yield. Anal.
