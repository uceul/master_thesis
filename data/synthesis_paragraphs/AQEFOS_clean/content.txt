A mixture of Na2MoO4·2H2O (0.48 g, 1.98 mmol), H3PO4 (1 mL, 7.96 mmol), CuCl2·2H2O (0.23 g, 1.35 mmol), pz (0.07 g, 0.87 mmol) and H2O (10 mL) was stirred for an hour. The pH was adjusted to 2.6 with 2 M HCl, then sealed in an 18 mL Teflon-lined reactor and heated at 160 °C for 3 days. After the reactor was slowly cooled to room temperature over a period of 10 °C/h, black block crystals were filtered, washed with water, and dried at room temperature (yield 56%, based on Mo). C24H25ClCu5N12O40PMo12 (2656.94): Calc: C, 10.85%; H, 0.94%; N, 6.33%. Found: C, 10.26%; H, 1.09%; N, 6.15%. IR (solid KBr pellet, cm−1): 3440 (w), 3250 (w), 3080 (w), 2920 (w), 1610 (w), 1420 (s), 1160 (m), 953 (s), 866(w), 779 (s), 669 (w).
