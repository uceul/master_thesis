2: A mixture of CuSO4⋅5H2O (25 mg, 0.1 mmol) and 1 (135 mg, 0.05 mmol) was placed in a small vial containing DMSO (1 mL), H2O (0.1 mL), and sBuOH (1 mL). The vial was sealed, heated at 80 °C for one day, and the turquoise block‐like crystals of 2 were collected, washed with diethyl ether, and dried in air. Yield: 57.0 mg, 75 % based on Cu. Elemental analysis (%): calcd for C144H162Cu13N12O58S9: C 42.15, H 3.98, Cu 20.13, N 4.10, S 7.03; found: C 41.97, H 3.91, Cu 20.02, N 4.05, S 6.97.
