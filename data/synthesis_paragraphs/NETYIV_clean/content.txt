Synthesis of Compound 2: A mixture of (NH4)6Mo7O24·6H2O (0.1 mmol), CuCl2·2H2O (0.3 mmol), 4,4′‐bipy (0.3 mmol), and H2O (10 mL) was stirred for half an hour in air. The pH was then adjusted to 4.8 with 4 M HCl and the mixture transferred to a Teflon‐lined, 23‐mL autoclave and kept at 165 °C for 4 d. After slowly cooling to room temperature, orange crystals were filtered off, washed with distilled water, and dried in a desiccator at room temperature. Yield: 0.079 g (37.5 % based on Mo).
