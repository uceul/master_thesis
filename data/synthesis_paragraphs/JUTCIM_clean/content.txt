H2dnpdc (0.075 mmol, 0.025 g) and Cu(NO3)2 (0.1 mmol, 0.024 g) were dissolved in DMA (N,N′-dimethylacetamide)–EtOH–H2O (5 mL, v/v/v = 3/1/1) mixture with 0.2 mL ethyl glycol (EG) under stirring for 40 min at room temperature. The resulting mixture was then sealed in a capped vial and heated at 85 °C for 24 hours. After cooling to room temperature slowly, blue prism-shaped crystals of 1 were collected (yield: 76%). Elemental analysis calc. for (C30H48N6O15Cu, M = 796.29): C, 45.25; H, 6.08; N, 10.55. Found: C, 45.09; H, 6.01; N, 10.12%.
