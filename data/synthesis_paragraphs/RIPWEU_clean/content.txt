A mixture of K12.5Na1.5[Na(H2O)P5W30O110]⋅15 H2O (0.300 g, 0.037 mmol), Sm(NO3)3⋅6 H2O (0.070 g, 0.16 mmol), CuCl2⋅5 H2O (0.200 g, 0.88 mmol), and iminodiacetic acid (0.077 g, 0.58 mmol) in sodium acetate buffer (8 mL, 0.5 M, pH 3.6) was stirred for 10 min. The resulting mixture was sealed in a 35 mL stainless‐steel reactor with a Teflon liner and heated at 120 °C for 5 d, then cooled to room temperature. Blue block crystals of 2 were obtained. The glycine ligand and oxalate ligand in the product were from the decomposition of iminodiacetic acid. Yield: 35 % based on K12.5Na1.5[Na(H2O)P5W30O110]⋅15 H2O.
