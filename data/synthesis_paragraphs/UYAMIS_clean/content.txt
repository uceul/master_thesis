A mixture of Cd(NO3)2·4H2O (0.062 g, 0.2 mmol), H2BDC (0.033 g, 0.2 mmol), MTAZ (0.017 g, 0.4 mmol), and 6 mL DMF/1,4-dioxane (v/v = 2:1) in a 20 mL vial, while stirring at room temperature. After a few minutes, the mixed solution was sealed, heated at 100 °C for 6 days and then slowly cooled to room temperature. Light yellow block-shaped crystals of as-synthesized 1 were collected in 45% yield based on Cd(II). The phase purity of compound was checked by powder X-ray diffraction (Figure S1).
