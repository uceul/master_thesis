A mixture of Cd(NO3)2·6H2O (0.103 g, 0.3 mmol) and H4btec (0.127 g, 0.5 mmol) in 10 mL DMF was sealed in a 23 mL Teflon-lined autoclave and kept at 130 °C for 3 days, then slowly cooled to room temperature. The result colorless prism-like crystals of 1 were washed with DMF to give pure samples (yield: 76% based on Cd). Anal. Calcd for Cd2C12.4H11.6O10.8N0.8: C, 26.15; H, 2.05; N, 1.97. Found: C, 26.32; H, 2.13; N, 1.86.
