A mixture of Co(NO3)2·6H2O (0.07 g, 0.24 mmol), DBIBN (0.04 g, 0.12 mmol), and conc. HCl (0.1 mL) in EtOH/H2O (3 mL, 2:1 v/v) were placed in a Teflon lined stainless steel autoclave and heated at 180 °C for 3 days under autogenous pressure. Then it was allowed to cool to room temperature at the rate of 1 °C/min. Needle-shaped reddish brown crystals of 1 were collected in 50% yield. The crystals were repeatedly washed with ethanol and air-dried. Anal. Calcd for C63H57N12O15ClCo2: C, 55.01; H, 4.17; N, 12.21%. Found: C, 54.24; H, 3.98; N, 11.91%.
