 A mixture of Zn(NO3)2·6H2O (0.5 mmol, 0.149 g), 1,2,4,5-benzene tetracarboxylic dianhydride (BTD) (0.5 mmol, 0.104 g), NH3·H2O (0.5 mL), and H2O (7.5 mL) was heated at 110 °C for 48 h in a 20 mL sealed Teflon-lined stainless steel vessel. After the autoclave was cooled over a period of 16 h at a rate of 5 °C h−1, colorless cubic-shaped crystals of 2 were isolated by filtration, washed with water, and dried in air. Yield: 0.066 g, 57% base on Zn. Anal. calcd for C20H22O25Zn4: C, 26.00; H, 2.40%. Found: C, 26.16; H, 2.33%. IR data (Fig. S1b; KBr, cm−1): 3339m, 3144m, 3122s, 1636w, 1478m, 1462m, 1444m, 1384m, 1345w, 1327w, 1233m, 1209m, 1177s, 1151s, 1141s, 1130s, 1111m, 1044m, 1027m, 1009w, 938w, 875w, 689m, 584m.
