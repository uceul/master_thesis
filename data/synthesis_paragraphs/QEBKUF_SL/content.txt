 A mixture of L-H8 (10 mg, 0.008 mmol) and Zn(NO3)2·6H2O (20 mg, 0.07 mmol) was dissolved in a solvent mixture of DMF/H2O (6 mL/2 mL) in a screw-capped vial. After addition of 0.1 mL of HCl (3 M, aq.), the vial was capped and placed in an oven at 80 °C for two days. Colorless crystals (10.5 mg, 53.2%) were obtained after filtration.
