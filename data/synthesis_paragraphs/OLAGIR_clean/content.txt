1: Zn(OAc)2⋅2 H2O (0.5 g) was dissolved in H2O (10 mL) and then H3PO4 (0.46 mL, 85 wt % in water) and [Co(dien)2]Cl3 (0.58 g) were subsequently added while stirring. Finally, Me4NOH (6.0 mL, 10 wt % aqueous solution) was added to the reaction mixture. A homogeneous gel (pH≈7) was formed after stirring for 1 h, which was then sealed in a teflon‐lined stainless steel autoclave and heated at 130 °C for 6 days under static conditions. Orange rod‐shaped single crystals were separated from the remainder of the product by sonication, washed with distilled water, and then dried in air.
