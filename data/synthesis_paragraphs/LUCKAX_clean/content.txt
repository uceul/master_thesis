Cd(NO3)2·4H2O (25 mg, 0.26 mmol) was added to the DMF/CH3CH2OH/H2O (3:3:2, 4 ml) solution of H4L (15 mg, 0.45 mmol), and the mixture was stirred for ca. 20 min in air. Then it was heated at 75 °C for 2 days, followed by slow cooling (5 °C h−1). The resulting light yellow crystals were washed with distilled water and dried in air (yield: ca. 60%).
