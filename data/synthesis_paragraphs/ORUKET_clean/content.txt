A mixture of the ligand (5.0 mg, 5.2 μmol), and Mg(NO3)2·6H2O (5.0 mg, 19.5 μmol) was dissolved in a mixed solvent of DMA (1.0 mL), ethanol (0.5 mL) and deionized water (0.5 mL) in a 20 mL vial. After 20 μL of 6 M HCl was added, the vial was capped and heated statically at 373 K for 8 days. Subsequently, the reaction mixture was allowed to cool to room temperature. The pure colorless block-shaped crystals that formed at the bottom of the vial were recovered by filtration and washed with DMA. The yield was approximately 31% based on the ligand. Based on single-crystal X-ray structure determination, TGA and microanalysis, the magnesium compound can be best formulated to be [Mg3L2(H2O)6]·6(Me2NH2)·DMA·H2O. Selected FTIR (KBr, cm−1): 1603, 1560, 1502, 1417, 1267, 1203, 1178, 1159, 1095, 1016, 952, 889, 868, 793, 760, 741, 700, 640, 623, 557, 507, 482; Anal. Calcd. for C100H119N13O44P6Mg3: C, 48.71; H, 4.86; N, 7.38. Found: C, 48.68; H, 4.71; N, 7.52.
