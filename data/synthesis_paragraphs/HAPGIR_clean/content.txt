Synthesis of [Mn3(btca)2(HCOO)(μ3‐OH)(H2O)2]·2DMF (1): A mixture of Mn(Ac)2·4H2O (0.20 mmol, 49.0 mg), H2btac (0.1 mmol, 16.3 mg), N,N′‐dimethylformamide (4 mL), and acetonitrile (1 mL) was stirred for 10 min in air, then transferred and sealed in a 23‐mL Teflon‐lined autoclave, which was heated in an oven to 120 °C for 72 h. The reaction mixture was slowly cooled to room temperature at a rate of 5 K·h–1, and the light yellow crystals were obtained about 28 % yield (10.2 mg based on H2btac). C21H26Mn3N8O11 (731.3): calcd. C 34.46; H 3.56; N 15.31 %; found: C, 34.37; H, 3.53; N, 15.27 %.
