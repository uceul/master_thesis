Synthesis of 1: A mixture of Co(AC)2·4H2O (0.05 mmol, 12 mg), 4,5-bis(4′-carboxylphenyl)-phthalic acid (0.05 mmol, 20.3 mg) and H2O (10 ml) was placed in a Teflon-lined stainless steel vessel (25 ml), heated to 160 °C for 4 days, and then slowly cooled down to room temperature. Red block crystals were isolated in 20% yield (based on Co). C22H15O11Co2.5: Calc. C, 43.84; H, 2.51; O, 29.20; found C, 43.72; H, 2.23; O, 28.43.
