Single crystals of Cu4(H3N–(CH2)9–NH3)(OH)2[C6H2(COO)4]2·5H2O were synthesized in the presence of 1,9‐diaminononane. An aqueous solution of Cu(NO3)2 (5 ml, 0.1 M) was added to a solution of 1,9‐diaminononane (5 ml, 0.2 M). A precipitate, which appeared intermediately, was dissolved by addition of a small amount of 2 M HNO3. Afterwards, a solution of sodium benzene‐1,2,4,5‐tetracarboxylate (5 ml, 0.05 M) and urea (0.2 g) were added. The resulting solution was heated at 80 °C for 3 d in a drying oven yielding turquoise parallelepipeds. C29H40N2Cu4O23 (Mw 1038.79) C 33.58 (calcd. 33.53); H 3.88 (4.09); N 2.70 (2.60)%.
