The iron arsenate oxalate I was synthesized hydrothermally starting from a mixture containing piperazine. In a typical synthesis, 0.099 g of iron oxalate was dissolved in 2 ml of water followed by the addition of 0.3826 g of As2O5 under continuous stirring. Finally 0.0478 g of piperazine was added and the mixture was homogenized for 30 min at room temperature. The final mixture with the composition, Fe(C2O4).2H2O:3As2O5:C4N2H10 :200H2O, was sealed in a 23-ml PTFE-lined stainless steel autoclave and heated at 150 °C for 48 h under autogeneous pressure. The initial pH of the mixture was about 2.0 and after the reaction the pH did not show any appreciable variation. The resulting product, a mixture of powder and pale greenish single crystals, was filtered under vacuum and dried at ambient temperature. The single crystals were separated easily from the mixture physically under a polarizing microscope. The same reaction mixture at 125 °C for 96 h yielded a single phasic pale greenish powder, which was identified as the title compound by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), by comparison with the simulated XRD pattern from single crystal data. This sample was used for all other characterizations such as thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and magnetic measurements. EDAX analysis gave an Fe:As ratio of 1:1.5 which matches with the composition obtained from the single-crystal X-ray study.
