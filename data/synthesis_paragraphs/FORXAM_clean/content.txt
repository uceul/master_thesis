Zn(NO3)2·6H2O (0.290 g, 0.98 mmol) and H2(ip) (0.162 g, 0.98 mmol) were dissolved in dimethylformamide (DMF, 15 mL), and the resulting solution was heated to 110 °C for 14 h in a sealed vial. After filtering off a small amount of white precipitate, the filtrate was divided into 5 equal portions. Freshly prepared solutions of dabco (0.044 g, 0.39 mmol) in CH3CN (2.0 mL) were carefully layered on each of the DMF solution. Shiny crystals deposited within several days; however, they were collected after 5 months to maximize the yield. The product was washed with DMF, guest-exchanged with CHCl3, and dried under vacuum for 12 h. The yield was 0.210 g or 75% based on Zn4(ip)4(dabco)(OH2)2(DMF). EA Calcd: C, 43.22; H, 3.45; N, 3.69. Found: C, 43.60; H, 3.97; N, 4.37%.
