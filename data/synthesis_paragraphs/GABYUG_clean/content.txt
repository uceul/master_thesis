CdCl2·H2O (24 mg, 0.12 mmol) and H2L (20 mg, 0.06 mmol) ligand were dissolved in a mixture of DMF (1.5 mL) and MeOH (1.5 mL) by sonication for 15 min. After that, two drops of conc. HCl were added to the solution. The resulting solution was heated in a sealed glass tube at 80 °C for 2 days using a block heater. After spontaneous cooling to room temperature, colorless prism-shaped crystals were collected by filtration, washed with DMF (10 mL) and methanol (10 mL), and dried in air. The yield was 14 mg (0.007 mmol, 31%) based on the Cd salt. Anal. Calcd for C45H43N27O10Cd5Cl6 (1896.77): C, 28.83; H, 2.94; N, 19.76. Found: C, 28.50; H, 2.28; N, 19.93%.
