A mixture of CuCl2·2H2O (17.9 mg, 0.1 mmol), KH3L1 (16.9 mg, 0.05 mmol), DMF (2 mL), and H2O (6 mL) was sealed in a 25 mL Teflon-lined reactor. The reactor was heated at 80 °C for 72 h and then cooled to room temperature at a rate of 5 °C h–1. Blue prism crystals of were obtained in 55% yield based on KH3L1. Anal.
