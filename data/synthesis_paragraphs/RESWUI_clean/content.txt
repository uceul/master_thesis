Preparation of Er2(BDC-F4)3(DMF)(H2O)·DMF (2). A mixture of Er(NO3)3·5H2O (0.0497 g, 0.112 mmol) with H2BDC-F4 (0.0400 g, 0.168 mmol) in a solution containing DMF (3 mL), C2H5OH (3 mL), and H2O (3 mL) in a sealed vial (20 mL) was heated at 80 °C for 24 h. Light-purple crystals of 2 were filtered, dried in air, and collected in ca. 43% yield [on the basis of Er(NO3)3·5H2O]. Anal. Calcd for 2, C30H16Er2F12N2O15: C, 29.85; H, 1.34; N, 2.32. Found:  C, 29.66; H, 1.06; N, 1.98. Er2(BDC-F4)3(DMF)·DMF (2a) was formed by heating compound 2 under vacuum at 140 °C overnight. Anal. Calcd for 2a, C30H14Er2F12N2O14: C, 30.30; H, 1.19; N, 2.36. Found:  C, 30.33; H, 1.22; N, 2.43.
