 A mixture of H4L (5.0 mg, 11.8 μmol), and CuCl2·2H2O (15.0 mg, 88.0 μmol) was dissolved in a mixed solvent of N,N-dimethyl formamide (DMF, 1.5 mL), CH3OH (0.5 mL) and H2O (0.1 mL). After addition of 100 μL of 6 mol L−1 HCl, the vial was capped and heated at 353 K for 108 h. After cooling to room temperature, blue hexagon-shaped crystals were obtained. Yield: 40% based on the organic ligands. The crystals are insoluble in common organic solvents such as DMF, N,N-dimethyl acetamide (DMA), acetone, THF, dioxane, MeOH, EtOH and chloroform. Based on single-crystal X-ray structural determination, TGA and microanalysis, ZJNU-54 can be best formulated to be [Cu2L(H2O)2]·5DMF·H2O. Selected FTIR (KBr, cm−1): 1655, 1560, 1439, 1371, 1254, 1209, 1103, 775, 729, 661, 652, 486; anal. for C35H50N8O16Cu2, calcd: C, 43.52%, H, 5.22%, N, 11.60%; found: C, 43.45%, H, 5.09%, N, 11.71%.
