 A mixture of Mn(NO3)2 aqueous (48 μL, 0.5 mmol) and H4BCBAIP (22.5 mg, 0.05 mmol) was dissolved in DMF (5 mL) and HNO3 (10 μL, 2.7 M in DMF), after stirring for 15 min, the mixture was sealed in a vial and kept at 95 °C for 72 h. After cooling to room temperature, the light brown needle-like crystals were collected by filtration, washed with DMF and air-dried. Anal.
