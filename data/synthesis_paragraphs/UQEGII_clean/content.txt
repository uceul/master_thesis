A mixture of H3PMo12O40⋅x H2O (0.42 g, 0.23 mmol), NH4VO3 (0.44 g, 3.8 mmol), Na2SO3 (0.8 g, 6.4 mmol) was dissolved in 5 mL of distilled water at room temperature. The pH was acidified to 5.0 with diluted HCl (2 m). Then, bpz (0.016 g, 0.1 mmol) and NiCl2⋅6 H2O (0.13 g, 0.80 mmol) were added to the mixture, which was transferred and sealed in a 12 mL Teflon‐lined stainless steel container, and heated at 120 °C for 3 days. After slow cooling to room temperature, dark blue crystals were filtered and washed with distilled water (39 % based on Mo).
