Synthesis of {[Eu(Bci)2]Cl}n (1). Eu2O3 (0.044g, 0.125 mmol), 4-(chloromethyl)-benzoic acid (0.17g, 0.1 mmol) and 1-[(4-methylphenyl)sulfonyl]-1H-Imidazole (0.11g,0.5 mmol) were mixed in 8 mL H2O and the mixture was sealed into a 10 mL stainless-steel autoclave at 120 °C for 3 days. Then slowly cooled to room temperature at a rate of 5 °C/h. After filtration, the product was washed with distilled water and dried in air, and crystals of 1 were obtained suitable for X-ray diffraction analysis. (yield: 47%). Anal. Calcd. for C26H28Mn3N6O12: C, 53.19, H, 3.52, N, 6.53. Found: C, 53.47, H, 3.66, N, 6.34%. IR (KBr, ν/cm- 1): 1680s, 1410s, 1283s, 1336s, 692 m, 648 m.
