III(HAsO4)6(AsO4)2(C2O4)3], I, was synthesized under hydrothermal conditions using iron (II) oxalate dihydrate as the source of iron. In a typical synthesis, 0.297 g of iron (II) oxalate dihydrate was dissolved in 4 mL of millipore water. Then, 1.249 g of H3AsO4 was added to the mixture. Finally 0.28 mL of 1,2-diaminopropane (1,2-DAP) (99%) was added and the mixture was homogenized for 30 min at room temperature. The final mixture with the composition, 1.5FeC2O4⋅2H2O : 8H3AsO4 : 3(1,2-DAP) : 200H2O, was transferred to a 23 mL acid-digestion bomb and heated at 150 °C for 3 days. The initial and final pH of the reaction mixture was ∼2 and there was no appreciable change in the pH during the reaction. The resulting colorless needle-like crystals were filtered and washed with distilled water and dried at ambient conditions. The yield of the product was ∼80% based on iron (II) oxalate. An EDAX analysis on many single crystals indicated an As : Fe ratio of 4 : 3, agreeing with the single crystal structure. C, H, N analysis, obsd. (calcd.): C = 10.10 (9.26), H = 2.78 (2.2), N = 4.35 (4.32).
