 A mixture of Zn(NO3)2·6H2O (0.2 mmol), H2AzDC (0.2 mmol) and L (0.2 mmol) in DMF (15 ml) in a ratio of 1:1:1 was sealed in a Teflon reactor, heated at 115 °C for 3 days, and then cooled to room temperature at 3 °C h−1. Subsequently, orange slice crystals were obtained in 50% yield based on Zn. Element analysis (%) for 4: calc.: C 62.65, H 3.77, N 11.31; found: C 62.45, H 3.54, N 11.13.
