 A mixture of 5-(pyridin-4-yl)isophthalic (H2pyip, 0.030 g, 0.05 mmol) and Co(NO3)2·6H2O (0.0437 g, 0.15 mmol) in N,N′-dimethylformamide (DMF) (3 mL), ethanol (3 mL) and water (2 mL) was placed in a Teflon-lined stainless steel vessel (12 mL), heated at 80 °C for 72 h and then cooled to room temperature at a rate of 5 °C h−1. The resulting pink prism-like crystals of 1 were isolated by washing with DMF–ethanol and dried in vacuo. The yield was 30.2% based on H2pyip. Anal. calc. for C52H36Co4N4O22: C, 47.87; H, 2.78; N, 4.29. Found: C, 47.79; H, 2.83; N, 4.24%. IR (KBr, cm−1): 3419 m, 1619 s, 1577 m, 1439 m, 1370 s, 1297 w, 831 w, 780 w, 707 w, 643 w.
