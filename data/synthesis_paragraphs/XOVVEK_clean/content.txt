A mixture of 1,3-H2bdc (0.042 g, 0.25 mmol), Zn(NO3)2·6H2O (0.074 g, 0.25 mmol), Htrz (0.035 g, 0.50 mmol), and water (6 mL) was placed in a Teflon-lined stainless steel vessel (23 mL), and then, the pH value was adjusted to 6.5 by NaOH (0.5 M). The mixture was sealed and heated at 160 °C for 3 days; then, the reaction system was cooled to room temperature. Colorless block crystals were collected in 81% yield (0.046 g, based on Zn). Anal. calcd for C44H36Zn7N18O20: C, 33.14; H, 2.28; N, 15.81. Found: C, 32.84; H, 2.18; N, 15.91%. Selected IR data (KBr pellet): ν = 3386, 3111, 1701, 1610, 1545, 1441, 1390, 1097, 1005, 899, 471 cm−1.
