The second phase MIL-124 (Ga2(OH)4[C9O6H4]) was synthesized from a mixture of 0.6 g gallium nitrate (2.4 mmol), 0.37 g 1,2,4-btc (1.8 mmol) and 5 mL H2O (277.8 mmol), which was heated at 210 °C for 24 h. The initial and final pH values were 0.4 and 0.6, respectively. The powdered solid was filtered off and washed with deionized water and dried at room temperature. SEM examination of the MIL-124 phase shows large platelet-shaped crystals of 100−250 μm length (Figure 1).
