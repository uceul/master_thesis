Transparent colorless columnar crystals of NTHU‐8 were prepared from a reaction mixture containing Zn(NO3)2⋅6 H2O (0.2975 g, 1 mmol), H3PO4 (0.27 mL, 4 mmol), benzene‐1,2,4,5‐tetracarboxylic acid (H4btec; 0.289 g, 1.13 mmol), 4,4′‐bipyridine (bpy, 0.312 g, 2 mmol), dimethylformamide (DMF, 5 mL, 65 mmol), and H2O (5 mL, 278 mmol). The mixture was heated in a 23 mL Teflon‐lined autoclave at 180 °C for 1 day. The product was a single phase, with a yield of 80 % based on zinc.
