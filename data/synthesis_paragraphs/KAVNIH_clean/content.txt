A mixture of Co(NO3)·6H2O (29.1 mg, 0.1 mmol), tipb (50.4 mg, 0.1 mmol), H2adc (27.0 mg, 0.1 mmol), and 2 drops of pyridine in 5 mL of DMF was sealed in a 16 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel container and heated at 160 °C for 3 days. The container was then cooled to room temperature at a rate of 0.1 °C/min, and the red crystalline product was separated by filtration, washed with DMF, and dried in air. Yield: 62% (based on tipb). Despite extensive efforts, elemental analyses are not well reproduced, presumably because the solvent molecules in the frameworks are variable. IR (KBr pellets, cm–1): 3134, 1664, 1598, 1521, 1400, 1309, 1061, 963, 833, 656.
