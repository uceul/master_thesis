As a typical preparation procedure, a mixture of Eu(NO3)3·6H2O (134 mg, 0.3 mmol), 4,4′-bipyridine (10 mg, 0.06 mmol), and H2BDC (83 mg, 0.5 mmol) was dissolved in DMF (4 mL) and H2O (2 mL) at room temperature. The mixture in a 50 mL tube was left undisturbed at 60 °C for 4 days to give colorless crystals in 42% yield (based on Eu). Elemental Anal.
