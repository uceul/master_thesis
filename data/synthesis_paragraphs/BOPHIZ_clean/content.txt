A mixture of CdBr2 (0.138 g, 0.4 mmol), H4tpta (0.041 g, 0.1 mmol), NH3·H2O (0.1 mL/5 M, 0.5 mmol), and DMF (3 mL) was stirred, then sealed in a 15 mL Teflon-lined stainless autoclave at 130 °C for 6 days. After it was cooled to room temperature and subjected to filtration, yellow block crystals of 3 in yield of 86.7% (based on H4tpta) were recovered. Anal. calcd (%) for C60H70.5Cd2.5N6.5O20.5 (3): C, 48.31; H, 4.76; N, 6.10. Found: C, 49.63; H, 4.62; N, 6.03. IR data (KBr, cm−1): 3452 (b), 2352(w), 1570(s), 1368(vs), 826(w), 760(w), 588(w).
