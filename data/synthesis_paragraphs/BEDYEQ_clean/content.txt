Synthesis of PCN‐222: ZrCl4 (70 mg), FeTCPPCl (50 mg) and benzoic acid (2700 mg) in N,N‐diethylformamide (8 mL) were ultrasonically dissolved in a 20 mL Pyrex vial. The mixture was heated at 120 °C in an oven for 48 h. After cooling down to room temperature, dark brown needle‐shaped crystals were harvested by filtration (35 mg, 46 % yield).
