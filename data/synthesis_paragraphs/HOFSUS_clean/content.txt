 A mixture of Zn(NO3)2·6H2O (29.7 mg, 0.10 mmol), H3PyImDC (23.3 mg, 0.10 mmol) and bimb (28.6 mg, 0.10 mmol), N,N′-dimethylacetamide (DMA, 2 mL) and H2O (1 mL) was placed in a Parr Teflon-lined stainless steel vessel (25 cm3), and then the vessel was sealed and heated at 110 °C for 3 days. After slowly cooling to room temperature, colorless crystals of 1 were collected (yield: 45% based on Zn). Anal. Calcd for C14H14N4O5Zn: C, 43.83; H, 3.68; N, 14.60%; found: C, 43.87; H, 3.72; N, 14.58%. IR spectrum (cm−1): 3445w, 1713s, 1617s, 1583s, 1483s, 1393w, 1286w, 1221w, 1127m, 1025m, 843m, 791w, 752w, 729m.
