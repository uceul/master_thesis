Synthesis of [(CH3)2NH2]3[In3(BTB)4]⋅12 DMF⋅22 H2O (ZJU‐28): In a solution of DMF (36 mL), 1,4‐dioxane (24 mL), water (4 mL), and nitric acid (0.25 mL) 4,4′,4′′‐benzene‐1,3,5‐triyl‐tri‐benzoic acid (H3BTB, 532.0 mg, 1.2 mmol) and InCl3 (582.4 mg, 2.4 mmol) were dissolved. After the resulting solution had been kept at 130 °C for 24 h, it was cooled to room temperature and colorless needle‐like crystals were collected by filtration and washed with DMF (0.81 g, 58 % based on H3BTB). Elemental analysis: Calcd (%) for [(CH3)2NH2]3[In3(BTB)4]⋅12 DMF⋅22 H2O (C150H212In3N15O58, 3496.12): C, 51.51; H, 6.11; N, 6.01; Found: C, 51.14; H, 5.48; N, 6.65.
