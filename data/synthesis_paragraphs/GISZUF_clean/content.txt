 A mixture containing CdSO4·8/3H2O (38 mg, 0.05 mmol) and tpcb (9 mg, 0.025 mmol) in 2 mL of H2O was sealed in a glass tube and heated under autogenous pressure to 170 °C for 24 h. It was allowed to cool to room temperature at the rate of 5 °C per hour to produce colorless needle crystals of 1, which were collected by filtration, washed with water and EtOH, and dried in air. Yield: 60 mg (80% based on Cd). Anal. calcd. for C48H85Cd3N8O34S3: C, 32.47; H, 4.97; N, 6.18%. Found: C, 32.91; H, 4.89; N, 6.40%. IR (KBr disk): 1610 (s), 1426 (m), 1227 (m), 1117 (s), 1018 (m), 831 (m), 616 (m), 544 (m) cm−1.
