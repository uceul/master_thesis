 A mixture of CuSO4·5H2O (20 mg, 0.08 mmol), H3BTC (10 mg, 0.047 mmol) and 4,4′-bpy (10 mg, 0.06 mmol) was suspended in mixed solvents of EtOH (5 ml) and H2O (5 ml), and heated in a Teflon-lined steel bomb at 180 °C for 12 h. The green crystalline precipitate formed was collected, washed with water and dried in the air (yield: 30%).
