A mixture of Co(NO3)2 6H2O (0.447 g, 1.5 mmol), NaOH (0.060 g, 1.5 mmol), 5-NH2-bdc (0.182 g, 1.0 mmol), and H2O (15.0 mL) was stirred for 20 min in air. Then the mixture was placed in a 23 mL Teflon-lined autoclave and heated at 140 °C for 72 h. The autoclave was cooled over a period of 20 h at a rate of 5 °C h−1, and 1 as black-red block crystals were collected by filtration, washed with water, and dried at ambient temperature. Yield: 6.0 mg, 2% (based on 5-NH2-bdc). Elemental analyses for 1: C32H26Co5N4O27.5 (1201.22): Calc (%): C, 32.00; H, 2.18; N, 4.66. Found (%): C, 32.12; H, 2.36; N, 4.45.
