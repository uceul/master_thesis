Synthesis of {[Cu2(H2O)2(mtz)(μ3‐OH)(nip)]·H2O}n (1): CuSO4·5H2O (58.5 mg, 0.25 mmol), H2nip (42.0 mg, 0.2 mmol), and Hmtz (25.2 mg, 0.3 mmol) were dissolved in doubly deionized water (10.0 mL) and the initial pH of the mixture was adjusted to ca. 6.0 by triethylamine. Afterwards the mixture was sealed in a parr Teflon‐lined stainless steel vessel (23.0 mL) and heated at 150 °C for 72 h under autogenous pressure. After the mixture was cooled to room temperature at a rate of 4.5 K·h–1, blue block‐shaped crystals suitable for X‐ray analysis were obtained directly, washed with water and ethanol, and dried in air. Yield: 33 % (based on CuII salt). C10H13Cu2N5O10: calcd. C 24.50; H 2.67; N 14.28 %; found: C 24.50; H 2.66; N 14.29 %.
