 MOF 1 was readily synthesized by a solvothermal reaction: a mixture of L (12 mg, 0.029 mmol), H3btc (8 mg, 0.038 mmol), Zn(NO3)2·6H2O (16 mg, 0.054 mmol), DMF (2 mL) and an aliquot of HNO3 in EtOH (1 mL of a 0.03 M solution) was sealed in the autoclave at 80 °C for 2 days and then cooled to room temperature. Black rod crystals of 1 were collected in a ca. 10% yield based on Zn2+. The phase purity was confirmed by powder X-ray diffraction (Fig. S1 and S2 in the ESI). The formula was estimated as [Zn3L2(btc)2(H2O)]·3.5DMF·4H2O based on the single crystal structure analysis and IR, elemental and thermogravimetric analysis data.
