 CuCl2·2H2O (0.09 g, 0.54 mmol) and Na2WO4·2H2O (0.18 g, 0.54 mmol) were dissolved in 20 mL of distilled water under stirring at room temperature for 20 min. Then C6H5PO3H2 (0.10 g, 0.64 mmol) was added to the above solution under stirring, and the pH of the mixture was adjusted to 3–4 with 4 mol L−1 HCl. Finally, bipy (0.15 g, 0.96 mmol) was added. The resulting mixture was transferred to a 30 mL Teflon-lined autoclave and kept at 150 °C for 3 days, and then blue block crystals were obtained (yield: ca. 32% based on W).
