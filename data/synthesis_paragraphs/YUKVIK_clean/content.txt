Synthesis of 4 Ni: The compound could not be prepared in a crystalline form by means of conventional reactions at room temperature (see the Results and Discussion section), therefore a hydrothermal method was employed. A mixture of Ni(HCOO)2⋅2 H2O (0.19 g, 1.0 mmol), [C(NH2)3]Cl (0.12 g, 1.2 mmol), and NaHCOO⋅2 H2O (0.13 g, 1.2 mmol) in water (5 mL) in a small glass vessel was sealed in a Teflon‐lined stainless steel cell (25 mL), heated at 150 °C for 3 days under autogeneous pressure, and then cooled to room temperature. Green block crystals of 4 Ni were harvested in a yield of 19 % based on Ni(HCOO)2⋅2 H2O. Another batch synthesized by using double the amount of the starting chemicals but the same water volume produced microcrystals of 4 Ni in a higher yield of 69 %. Elemental analysis calcd (%) for C4H9N3O6Ni: C 18.93, H 3.57, N 16.55; found: C 18.85, H 3.90, N 16.44.
