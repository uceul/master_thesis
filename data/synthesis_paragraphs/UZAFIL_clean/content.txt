A mixture of NiCO3 (11.9 mg, 0.10 mmol), H2adi (14.6 mg, 0.10 mmol), L (16.8 mg, 0.05 mmol), and water (10 mL) was placed in a Teflon reactor (15 mL) and heated at 170 °C for 3 days. After the mixture had been cooled to room temperature at a rate of 10 °C h−1, blue crystals of 3 were obtained with a yield of 65% (based on NiCO3). Anal.
