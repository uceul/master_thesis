A mixture of Co(NO3)2·6H2O (0.058 g, 0.2 mmol), H4pdpa (0.043 g, 0.1 mmol), NaOH (0.016 g, 0.4 mmol), a 1:2:8 CH3CN/CH3OH/H2O mixture (2 mL), and 1,4-dioxane (or THF) (8 mL) was placed in a 25 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel container. The container was sealed and heated at 160 °C for 3 days. After the mixture had cooled to ambient temperature at a rate of 5 °C/h, purple crystals of 3 were obtained with a yield of 65% (based on Co). Anal. Calcd for C42H50Co5O30: C, 37.94%; H, 3.79%. Found: C, 37.84%; H, 3.68%. IR (KBr, cm–1): 3375 (m), 3149 (m), 1662 (m), 1506 (m), 1285 (w), 1007 (m), 745 (vw).
