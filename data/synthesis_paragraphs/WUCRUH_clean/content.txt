[FeII3(H2O)5(C9O6H3)2·3H2O] or MIL-65 was synthesized hydrothermally under autogenous pressure from a mixture of iron powder (Riedel-de-Haën, 99%+), VCl3 (Aldrich), 1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylate (Aldrich, 95%), H2O with the molar ratios 1:1:1:80 (5 ml). 0.5 ml of NaOH or KOH (10 mol·l−1) solution need to be added to the mixture as well as vanadium chloride in order to synthesize MIL-65. The mixture was realized in a 23 ml Teflon bottle and then sealed in a Parr acid digestion bomb heated at 453 K for 2 days and then cooling for 2 days at ca. 0.05 K·min−1. The resulting dark green paste was filtered, washed with distilled water and dried at room temperature. In this dark bulk, few yellow crystals (Fig. 1) of MIL-65 were isolated, and washed in an ultrasonic bath for a few minutes before performing analysis and/or further characterizations.
