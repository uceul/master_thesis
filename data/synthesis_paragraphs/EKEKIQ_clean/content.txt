A mixture of 2-propylimidazole (2-pim, 0.0150 g, 0.14 mmol), NH2–H3BTB (0.0150 g, 0.035 mmol), Zn(NO3)2·6H2O (0.0400 g, 0.14 mmol), tetramethylammonium bromide (0.0200 g, 0.13 mmol), and DMF/H2O (v/v = 3:0.5, 3.5 mL) was heated in a 20 mL scintillation vial at 100 °C for 24 h, followed by cooling to room temperature. The resulting colorless block crystals were washed with DMF and water and dried in air. Anal. Calcd for [Zn2(NH2–BTB)][2-pim]·3DMF·6H2O: Calcd C, 49.31; H, 4.89; N, 8.22; found C, 48.9; H, 4.73; N, 8.11%.
