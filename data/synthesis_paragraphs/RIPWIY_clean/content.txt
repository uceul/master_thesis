A mixture of K12.5Na1.5[Na(H2O)P5W30O110]⋅15 H2O (0.207 g, 0.026 mmol), Sm(NO3)3⋅6 H2O (0.062 g, 0.14 mmol), Mn(ClO4)2⋅6 H2O (0.300 g, 0.83 mmol), and glycolic acid (0.100 g, 1.3 mmol) in sodium acetate buffer (8 mL, 0.5 M, pH 5.5) was stirred for 30 min. The resulting mixture was sealed in a 35 mL stainless‐steel reactor with a Teflon liner and heated at 120 °C for 5 d, then cooled to room temperature. Light yellow block crystals of 1 were obtained. Yield: 38 % based on K12.5Na1.5[Na(H2O)P5W30O110]⋅15 H2O.
