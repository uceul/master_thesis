1: A mixture of L1‐H4 (15 mg, 0.030 mmol) and Cu(NO3)2⋅2.5 H2O (30 mg, 0.13 mmol) in def/H2O (4.5 mL/1.5 mL) mixed solvents was placed in a screw‐capped vial. After addition of several drops of HCl (3 M, aq.), the vial was capped and placed in an oven at 80 °C for one day. Blue crystals of 1 were collected by filtration (27.6 mg, 72 %). Solvent content calcd (%) from the proposed formula: def: 46.7, H2O: 5.5; determined by 1H‐NMR/TGA: def: 46.4, H2O 5.1. Compound 2 was similarly synthesized.
