A mixture of Zn(NO3)2·6H2O (0.0037 g, 0.0125 mmol), L (0.0044 g, 0.0125 mmol), H2bpca (0.0030 g, 0.0125 mmol) and DMF (8 mL) was placed in a 15 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave. The mixture was kept under autogenous pressure at 80 °C for 4 days. Then the mixture was cooled to room temperature, and blue block crystals of 1 were obtained in a 40% yield based on Zn.
