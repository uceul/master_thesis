Zn2(MTB)(H2O)2·(DMF)6(H2O)5, MOF-36. H4MTB (0.020 g, 0.04 mmol), Zn(NO3)2·4H2O (0.053 g, 0.20 mmol), DMF (3 mL), C2H5OH (3 mL), and H2O (2.4 mL) were added respectively to a vessel, which was sealed and heated to 70 °C at a rate of 2 °C/min for 72 h and then cooled to room temperature at a rate of 1 °C/min. Large colorless crystals of the product were formed and collected by filtration, yielding 0.030 g (63% yield based on H4MTB). The product gradually turned opaque in air. Anal.
