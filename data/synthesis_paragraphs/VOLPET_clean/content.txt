H2thb (52 mg, 0.3 mmol), Zn(NO3)2·6H2O (80 mg, 0.27 mmol), and tetrabutylammonium bromide (100 mg, 0.31 mmol) were dissolved in 5 mL of DMF/MeCN (4:1, v/v), which were placed in a small vial. The mixture was heated at 100 °C for 48 h and then cooled to room temperature. Only a few colorless block crystals were synthesized and collected by filtration and washed with DMF several times (yield: 15% based on H2thb).
