 A mixture of Ce(NO3)3·6H2O (0.2 mmol), AgNO3 (0.2 mmol), H3bidc (0.2 mmol), and water (10 mL) was sealed in a 23 mL Teflon reactor and was kept under autogenous pressure at 170 °C for 5 days, then cooled to room temperature over 3 days. Light yellow square-shaped crystals were filtered off, washed with distilled water and dried in air. Finally, 0.1052 g (76% yield based on Ce(NO3)3) crystals were obtained. The as-synthesized material is insoluble in water and common organic solvents. Elem. Anal. Calcd. for C18 H12 AgCeN4 O10 (%): C, 31.22; H, 1.74; N, 8.09. Found: C, 30.13; H, 1.68; N, 8.02.
