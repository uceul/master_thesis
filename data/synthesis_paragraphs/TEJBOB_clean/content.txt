A mixture of AgNO3 (0.102 g, 0.60 mmol), tptz (0.03 g, 0.10 mmol), (NH4)6Mo7O24·4H2O (0.037 g, 0.3 mmol) and water (8 mL) was placed in a Teflon reactor, and the pH value was adjusted to about 5. The mixture was heated at 130 °C for 3 days, and then it was gradually cooled to room temperature. Colorless crystals of 1 were obtained in a 27% yield. Anal.
