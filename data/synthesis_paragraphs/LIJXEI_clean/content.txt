Synthesis of 1: A mixture of Cd(OAc)2 · 2H2O (0.4 mmol), H2pam (0.10 mmol), NaOH (0.20 mmol), 4,4′-bpy (0.1 mmol) and CH3CH2OH (10 mL) was stirred for 30 min in air, then sealed in a 25 mL Telfon-lined stainless steel container, which was heated to 160 °C for 72 h. After cooling to room temperature at a rate of 2 °C per hour, light–yellow block crystals were obtained in ca. 40% yield base on Cd. Anal. calc. for (%) for C76H64Cd5 N4O23: C: 46.45, H: 3.26, N: 2.85; found: C: 46.43, H: 3.30, N: 2.87.
