 A mixture of Cd(NO3)2·4H2O (154 mg, 0.50 mmol), H2bdc (83mg, 0.50 mmol), btre (82 mg, 0.50 mmol) and water (15 mL) was stirred for 30 min. at room temperature and the pH value of the final mixture was adjusted to 5.00 by addition of triethylamine, then the mixture is transferred to a Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave and heated at 160 °C for 3 d, then it was cooled to room temperature at a rate of 10 °C h−1. A colorless crystalline product, which was suitable for X-ray single crystal analysis, was filtered off, washed with distilled water and dried in air (Yield 115 mg, 54% based on Cd). Elemental analysis C20H22Cd2N14O11 (859.32) calcd.
