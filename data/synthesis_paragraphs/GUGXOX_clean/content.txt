Synthesis of [H2ampy][Be3(HPO4)4] (2): A mixture of BeSO4·4H2O (0.170g), H3PO4 (0.30 mL), 3‐(aminomethyl)pyridine (0.20 mL), methanol (4.40 mL), and H2O (0.60 mL) was sealed in a 25 mL Teflon‐lined autoclave and heated at 160 °C for 9 d. The initial pH of the reaction mixture was found to be about 5. After cooling to room temperature, the resulting product, containing colorless crystals of 2, was recovered by filtration, washed with distilled water, and dried in air (46.7 % yield based on beryllium). CHN elemental analysis confirmed its stoichiometry. [C6N2H10][Be3(HPO4)4] (521.10): calcd. C 13.83, H 1.93, N 5.38 %; found: C 13.64, H 1.74, N 5.27 %.
