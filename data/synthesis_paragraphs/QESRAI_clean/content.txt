The zinc phosphate, [C8N5H28][Zn5(PO4)5].H2O, I, is synthesized under hydrothermal conditions in the presence of TEPA. In a typical synthesis, 0.3 g of ZnO was dispersed in a mixture of 6.634 ml of deionized water and 0.22 ml of hydrochloric acid (35%). To this, 0.425 ml of H3PO4 (85 wt.%) and 0.7 ml of TEPA were added dropwise under continuous stirring. The resulting homogenized gel with a composition of ZnO: 2H3PO4: 0.7HCl: TEPA: 100H2O was sealed in a 7 ml PTFE-lined acid digestion pressure vessel and heated at 180Â°C for 28 h. The resulting product contained colorless rod-like crystals of I was filtered, washed with water and dried at ambient conditions. Initial characterization was carried out using powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). An EDAX analysis indicated a Zn:P ratio of 1:1, in agreement with formula derived using single crystal X-ray diffraction.
