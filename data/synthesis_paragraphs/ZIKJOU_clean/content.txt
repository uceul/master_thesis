A mixture of Cu(NO3)2·3H2O (0.030 g, 0.12 mmol), H4L·H2O (0.010 g, 0.02 mmol), DMF (1 mL), CH3OH (1 mL) and 3 drops HBF4 (40% in water) was sealed in a glass vial. The mixture was heated at 75 °C for 30 h, and then cooled to room temperature where some green microcrystals were formed. After that, an additional 4 drops of HBF4 (40% in water) were added to the mixture, and the solution become clear again. The mixture was then additionally heated at 75 °C for 30 h. Green crystals of 2 were obtained in a 42% yield based on H4L. Anal. calcd (%) for C24H31Cu2NO16 (2·8H2O): C 40.23, H 4.36, N 1.95; found (%): C 40.35, H 4.34, N 2.73. IR data (KBr, cm−1): 3421(b), 2929(w), 1655(vs), 1600(m), 1571(m), 1408(vs), 1384(m), 1288(m), 1253(m), 1179(s), 1161(m), 1100(m), 1084(m), 993(w), 766(m).
