A mixture of CoCl2⋅6 H2O (0.018 g, 0.075 mmol), H3imda (0.012 g, 0.075 mmol), 1,4‐dpb (0.01725 g, 0.075 mmol), and triethylamine (0.023 g, 0.023 mmol) was added to deionized water (15 mL) and stirred for 10 min. The resulting solution was heated in a 25 mL stainless‐steel reactor with a Teflon liner at 160 °C for 12 h. After a period of approximately 20 h of cooling to room temperature, orange prismatic crystals of 3 were obtained, isolated by filtration, and washed with water. Yield: 87 %; elemental analysis (%) calcd for C74H76N12O21Co3: C 54.00, H 4.65, N 10.21; found: C 54.00, H 4.25, N 10.35.
