A mixture of Co(Ac)2·4H2O (0.075 g, 0.30 mmol), H3BTT (0.028 g, 0.10 mmol), and DMA/methanol (1:1) was stirred for 10 min in air at room temperature. Then the mixture was transferred and sealed in a Teflon reactor (18 mL) and heated at 85 °C for 3 days. After the mixture was cooled to room temperature at 5 °C/h, red crystals of 1 were obtained (40.2% yield based on H3BTT). Elemental Anal. Calcd for C38H88N18O17Co2: C, 38.45; H, 7.42; N, 21.25. Found: C, 38.57; H, 7.39; N, 21.34%. IR data (KBr, cm–1): 3426 (s), 2940 (w), 1624 (s), 1508 (w), 1404 (m), 1262 (w), 1191 (w), 1065 (w), 1020 (m), 904 (w), 791 (s), 596 (m), 475 (s).
