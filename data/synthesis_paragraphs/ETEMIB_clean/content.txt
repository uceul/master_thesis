 A mixture of H3btc (0.02 mmol), Co(NO3)2·6H2O (0.04 mmol) in 7.5 mL H2O and btrb (0.02 mmol) in 0.2 mL DMF was adjusted to pH = 7 with dilute NaOH solution. The mixture was added to a 25 mL Teflon-lined stainless autoclave and sealed and then heated at 110 °C for 3 days and then cooled to room temperature to give the violet red crystals of 3·9H2O (yield: 0.012 g). Anal. calc. for C30H42Co4N6O25 (3·9H2O): C, 32.10; H, 3.77; N, 7.49%; found: C, 31.97; H, 3.84; N, 7.41%.
