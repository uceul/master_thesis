[Zn3(HL)2(H2O)2]⋅2 DMF⋅7 H2O (4): A mixture of ZnCl2 (0.005 g, 0.04 mmol) and H4L (0.018 g, 0.02 mmol) was dissolved in DMF (4 mL) and H2O (4 mL). The suspension was transferred into a Teflon‐lined autoclave and kept under autogenous pressure at 100 °C for 3 days, and then cooled to room temperature at a rate of 4 °C h−1. Colorless crystals of 4 were achieved by filtration in 36 % yield based on ZnII. IR (KBr pellet,): 3439(m), 2960(m), 2930(m), 2875(w), 1654(s), 1612(s), 1500(s), 1446(m), 1402(m), 1291(s), 1193(m), 1119(m), 1059(m), 926(w), 813(w), 719(w), 664 cm−1 (w); elemental analysis calcd (%) for C102H138N2O43Zn3: C 53.82, H 6.11, N 1.23; found: C 53.97; H 6.01; N 1.26.
