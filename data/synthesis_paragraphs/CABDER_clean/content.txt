Cd(NO3)2·4H2O (112 mg, 0.363 mmol), 4-pmina (79 mg, 0.37 mmol), 2,2-dimethylsuccinic acid (55 mg, 0.38 mmol), and 1 mL of a 1.0 M NaOH solution were mixed with 10 mL of distilled H2O in a 23 mL Teflon-lined acid digestion bomb. The bomb was sealed and heated in an oven at 100 °C for 96 h, and then was cooled slowly to 25 °C. Colorless crystals of 3 (102 mg, 55% yield based on Cd) were isolated after washing with distilled water, ethanol, and acetone and drying in air. Anal.
