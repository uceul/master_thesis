In a 20 mL glass vial, 51.3 mg of Mg(NO3)2·6H2O and 33.2 mg of H2BDC were dissolved in 2.0 g of DEA and 1.0 g of ethanol. The vial was sealed and placed in a 120 °C oven for 5 days. Large pure block colorless crystals were obtained after cooling to room temperature. The yield was about 85% based on Mg. Pure sample was obtained by filtering and washing the raw product with DEA.
