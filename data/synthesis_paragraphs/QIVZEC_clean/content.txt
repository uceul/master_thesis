 Compound 4 was synthesized under solvothermal conditions at 100 °C. Zn(NO3)2·6H2O (0.074 g, 0.25 mmol) was dissolved in 4 ml of deionized water to which an aqueous solution (2 ml) of H2muco (0.036 g, 0.25 mmol) neutralised with NaOH (0.020 g, 0.5 mmol) was added with constant stirring. To this solution an ethanolic solution (2 ml) of 4bpdh (0.060 g, 0.25 mmol) was added and the contents were stirred for 30 min and then transferred to a 30 mL glass vial, sealed with parafilm and heated at 100 °C for 3 days. After being cooled to room temperature, yellow block crystals of 4 were isolated. Yield (70%). Anal. calcd. for C94H86N20O18Zn4: C, 55.20; H, 4.23; N, 13.69; found: C, 55.80; H, 3.93; N, 14.23.
