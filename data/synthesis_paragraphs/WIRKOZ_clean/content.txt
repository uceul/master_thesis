 A solution of 5H2 (0.105 g, 0.144 mmol) and Zn(NO3)2·6H2O (0.129 g, 0.434 mmol) in DMF (10 mL) was prepared and transferred to a 23 mL Teflon-lined autoclave by filtering the solution through a puck of celite. The reaction vessel was sealed and heated to 110 °C for 72 h. Programmed cooling (0.1 °C min−1 from 110 °C to 25 °C) afforded a clear, orange solution which was transferred to stoppered glass vials. After 24 h, clear, colourless crystalline solids began to form in the vial (0.066 g, 59%). Single crystals suitable for X-ray diffraction were isolated and used in structural elucidation of PMOF-1. Confirmation of structure uniformity throughout the bulk sample was performed using PXRD. IR (cm−1) 2929, 1652, 1597, 1480, 1253, 1184, 1099, 819, 797, 768, 749.
