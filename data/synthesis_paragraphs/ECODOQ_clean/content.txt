The title compound was synthesized hydrothermally by a typical solution-mediated reaction: 0.05 g Ga2O3, 0.80 g H3PO3, 0.10 ml DETA, 0.40 ml HF and 8 ml of water were stirred for 30 min at room temperature, then the mixture was transferred to a 23 ml PTFE-lined stainless-steel hydrothermal autoclave with a filling capacity of ∼35% and heated at 170 °C for 5 d under autogenous pressure. The initial and final pH of reaction mixture was ∼1. Fine rod-shaped crystals, were filtered off, washed with water and dried at room temperature (yield=60% based on Ga).
