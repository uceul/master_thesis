 A mixture of In(NO3)3 (0.10 mmol, 33 mg), H4BPTC (0.10 mmol, 33 mg) and dabco (0.10 mmol, 11 mg) in DEF (5.0 ml, DEF = N,N′-diethylformamide) solvent with an additional HNO3 (0.1 ml) was sealed in a 23 ml glass vial, which was also heated at 85 °C for 5 days, and then cooled to room temperature. As for the charge equilibrium, the guest dabco molecules were protonated into charge-balancing Hdabco+ cations during the reaction process. After being washed with fresh MeCN and dried in air, colorless bulk crystals were obtained in ca. 40% product yield based on the H4BPTC ligand. Elemental analysis calculated for InOF-13: C, 44.28%; H, 4.50%; N, 5.09%. Found: C, 44.68%; H, 4.39%; N, 5.12%. The phase purity of the sample was also confirmed by PXRD (Fig. 3 and S6).
