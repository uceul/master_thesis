 The analytical grade starting chemicals were obtained from Aldrich and used as received. 3.60 g [CN3H6]2CO3, 0.41 g ZnO and 25 ml deionized water were combined in a 30 ml plastic bottle, shaken well, and placed in a 90 °C oven for 42 h. Solid product recovery from the pH 12 mother liquors resulted in 0.58 g (38% yield based on Zn) of large (to 3 mm), translucent octahedral chunks of [CN3H6]2[Zn(CO3)2]. The crystal quality of this initial batch was too poor for single crystal structure determination. Much better crystals were obtained from the following reaction: 0.31 g (5 mmol) H3BO3 and 3.60 g (20 mmol) [CN3H6]2CO3 were dissolved in 18.0 g deionized water at 90 °C in a HDPE bottle. 0.81 g (10 mmol) ZnO was added and the suspension shaken thoroughly. The bottle was placed in an oven and held at 90 °C for 68 h. The solid product, consisting of a majority of gem-like, faceted, transparent crystals (maximum dimension ≈0.2 mm) of [CN3H6]2[Zn(CO3)2] and a minority component of white powder, was recovered by filtration, washing with water, then with methanol, and dried at 90 °C. The yield was 26%, based on Zn. The boric acid is not incorporated in the crystalline product, but it may affect the nucleation rate of [CN3H6]2[Zn(CO3)2] crystals from solution, thus improving their quality.
