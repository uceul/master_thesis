 A mixture of the organic linker H4L (5.0 mg, 10.77 μmol) and Cu(NO3)2·3H2O (15.0 mg, 62.10 μmol) was dissolved into a mixed solvent of N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF), ethanol and H2O (1.5 mL/0.5 mL/0.08 mL) in a screw-capped vial (20 mL). 50 μL of 6 M HCl were then added. The vial was capped and heated at 353 K for 96 h. Blue rhombic crystals were obtained in 63% yield. Based on single-crystal X-ray determination, TGA, and microanalysis, ZJNU-47 can be best formulated as [Cu2L(H2O)2]·3DMF·3EtOH·2H2O. Selected FTIR (KBr, cm−1): 2929, 1655, 1450, 1381, 1300, 1254, 1095, 1061, 1049, 926, 854, 775, 760, 729, 661, 488; anal. for C35H55Cu2N5O18, calcd: C, 43.75%, H, 5.77%, N, 7.29%; found: C, 43.82%, H, 5.65%, N, 7.21%.
