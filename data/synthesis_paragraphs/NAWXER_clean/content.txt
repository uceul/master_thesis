Zn(NO3)2·6H2O (10 mg, 0.0336 mmol) and H4TCPP (4 mg, 0.0071 mmol) were dissolved in DMF (1 mL) and ethanol (0.5 mL), and then HNO3 (150 μL, 2.7 M in DMF) was added. The solution was sealed in a 20 mL vial and heated at 85 °C for 24 h, then cooled to room temperature. Colorless block-shaped crystals were collected by filtration. The agreement between the experiment and simulated PXRD patterns indicates the phase purity of as-synthesized Zn-TCPP (Figure S3).
