A mixture of L1 (21.0 mg, 0.10 mmol), Cd(NO3)2·4H2O (61.6 mg, 0.20 mmol), H3BTB (43.8 mg, 0.10 mmol) and NaOH (12.0 mg, 0.3 mmol) in DMF/H2O (1:3) solution (10 ml) was sealed in a Teflon-lined stainless steel container and heated at 120 °C for 3 days. After being cooled to room temperature, colorless block crystals of 2 were obtained in 42% yield based on L1. Anal. Calcd for C81H61N9O15Cd3: C, 55.99; H, 3.54; N, 7.25%. Found: C, 55.86; H, 3.52; N, 7.32%. IR (KBr pellet, cm−1): 3444 (m), 3129 (m), 1608 (s), 1582 (s), 1394 (s), 1181 (w), 1107 (w), 1077 w), 960 (w), 814 (m), 746 (s), 707 (m), 673 (w), 623 (w), 471 (w).
