Cd(NO3)2·4H2O (0.10 mmol), 2,6-H2ndc (0.050 mmol), di(3-pyridylmethyl)amine (0.025 mmol), DMAc (5 mL), and MeOH (0.5 mL) were mixed in an acid digestion bomb at 120 °C for 72 h and then cooled to 30 °C. The resulted pale-yellow prismatic crystals were collected by filtration, washed with distilled water, and naturally dried at room temperature. Yield: 84% (based on 2,6-ndc ligand). Anal. Calc. for C52H54Cd3N4O16: C, 47.02; H. 4.10; N, 4.22. Found: C, 46.69; H, 3.87; N, 3.99%. IR (cm−1): 1603w, 1540s, 1484m, 1396s, 1353m, 1191m, 1141w, 1104w, 935w, 842w, 779s.
