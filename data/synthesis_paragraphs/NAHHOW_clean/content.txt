 A mixture of H4L3 (5.0 mg, 12.2 μmol), and Cu(NO3)2·3H2O (15.0 mg, 62.1 μmol) was dissolved in a mixed solvent of DMF (1.5 mL), CH3CN (0.5 mL), and H2O (0.08 mL) in a 20 mL glass vial. After the addition of 6 M HCl (30 μL), the vial was sealed and heated to 353 K for 72 h and then cooled to room temperature. The block-shaped crystals formed were collected by filtration in 56% yield. Based on the single-crystal X-ray structural determination, TGA and elemental analyses, ZJNU-48 can be the best formulated as [Cu2L3(H2O)2]·3DMF·4CH3CN·3H2O. Elemental analysis calcd for C37H51N9O16Cu2: C, 44.22%, H, 5.12%, N, 12.54%; found: C, 44.11%, H, 5.06%, N, 12.57%; selected FTIR (KBr, cm−1): 1660, 1635, 1593, 1452, 1394, 1365, 1323, 1254, 1095, 775, 760, 729.
