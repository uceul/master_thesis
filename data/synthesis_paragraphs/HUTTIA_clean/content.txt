A mixture of Zn(NO3)·6H2O (18.0 mg, 0.061 mmol), H2hfipbb (25.3 mg, 0.065 mmol), and 1,4-bis(4-pyridyl)-2,3-diaza-1,3-butadiene (bpdab, 10.5 mg, 0.050 mmol) was suspended in DMF (20 mL), sealed in a 25 mL reaction tube, and heated in an oil bath at 100 °C for 60 h. This afforded yellow crystals of 3, which were collected by filtration, washed with methanol, and dried in air. Yield 24.5 mg (60.3%). Elemental analysis for C55H47F12N7O11Zn2 (calcd/found): C, 49.42/49.39; H, 3.54/3.53; N, 7.33/7.31. Selected IR(KBr, νmax): 3075(s), 1685(m), 1635(s), 1563(s), 1399(m), 1214(m), 962(m), 841(m) cm−1.
