Synthesis of 1: a mixture of isonicotinic acid (0.5 mmol), ZnF2·4H2O (0.5 mmol), isobutanol (0.8 mL), and methanol (0.7 mL) was sealed in a glass tube and heated at 110 °C for 4 days. After the mixture was cooled to room temperature, the colorless crystals were collected, washed with methanol, and dried in air. Yield: 45%. Anal. Calcd for 1: C, 27.56%; H, 2.49%; N, 4.95%. Found: C, 27.57%; H, 2.54%; N, 4.92%. IR (KBr pellets, cm− 1): 3433(m), 2987(s), 2900(s), 1625(s), 1592(s), 1249(m), 1394(s), 1066(s), 879(w), 775(w), 700(m). Crystal data and structure Refinements for 1 are summarized in Table S1. Selected bond lengths (Å) and angles (°) for 1 are listed in Table S2.
