Herein, we describe the solvothermal synthesis and X-ray crystal structure characterization of a new europium based MOF. Self-assembly of H3BPT and Eu3 + under solvothermal conditions generated a new compound named [Eu(BPT)(DMF)(H2O) · (H2O)0.5] (1): a mixture of Eu(NO3)3 ·6H2O (44.5 mg, 0.1 mmol), and H3BPT (28.9 mg, 0.1 mmol) was dissolved in 10 mL DMF/EtOH/H2O (V:V:V, 3:3:2). The final mixture was placed in a 20 mL glass vial, which was sealed and heated to 80 °C for 2 days, and then cooled to room temperature. Colorless crystals of 1 were collected in 57% yield (based on ligand H3BPT). Calcd for EuC18H17NO8.5: C, 40.37%; H, 3.18%; N, 2.62%. Found: C, 40.25%; H, 3.24%; N, 2.57%. IR (KBr, cm− 1): 3396 (br), 2924 (m), 2852 (m), 1622 (s), 1583 (s), 1536 (s), 1442 (s), 1404 (s), 863 (m), 778 (s), 717 (s). This compound was characterized by elemental analysis, IR spectra, X-ray powder diffraction and X-ray crystallography (see Figs. S1–S2) [9], [10]. Furthermore, the luminescent property of compound 1 was investigated.
