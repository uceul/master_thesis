 A mixture of CuCl2·2H2O (0.085 g, 0.5 mmol), TAAP (0.020 g, 0.1 mmol), (NH4)6Mo7O24·4H2O (0.124 g, 0.1 mmol), H2O (5 mL) and methanol (5 mL) was added into a 12 mL glass vial and heated at 85 °C for 4 days. After slow cooling to room temperature, green block crystals of 1 were filtered (final pH = 2.8), washed off the white precipitate with distilled water and dried at room temperature in a desiccator, giving a yield of 34% based on Mo. Anal. calcd for C32H78Cu2Mo16N24O77: C 10.41%; H, 2.13%; N, 9.10%. Found: C, 10.38%; H, 2.09%; N, 9.15%.
