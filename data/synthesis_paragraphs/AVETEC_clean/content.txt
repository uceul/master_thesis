 A mixture of Cd(NO3)2·4H2O (0.02 mmol, 6.1 mg), H6L2 (0.01 mmol, 4.8 mg), HCl (0.15 mL, 1 mol L−1) and DMF/H2O (6 mL, 5/1, v/v) was sealed in a 23 mL Teflon-lined autoclave and heated at 90 °C for 72 h. After cooling to room temperature at a speed of 10 °C h−1, colorless block crystals of C60H64N6Cd3O24 were obtained (58% yield based on Cd), washed with DMF/H2O and dried in air. Elemental analysis (wt%) found for 4: C, 45.47; H, 3.89; N, 5.36; calcd: C, 45.33; H, 4.03; N, 5.28.
