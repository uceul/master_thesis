 A mixture of FeCl2·4H2O (1.193 g, 6.0 mmol), H2bdc (0.996 g, 6.0 mmol), Hna (0.738 g, 6.0 mmol), HBF4 (50 wt% in H2O, 0.4 mL), and DMA (60.0 mL) was stirred for 30 min in air, then transferred into a 100 mL vial and sealed with a screw cap, which was heated in an oven at 140 °C for 48 h, and then cooled to room temperature at a rate of 5 °C h−1, giving dark brown crystals (yield 50%). EA calc. (%) for C218H248BF4Fe15N22O107 ([{Fe3O(C8H4O4)3}4{Fe(C6H4NO2)4(H2O)}3]BF4·10C4H9NO·10CH3OH·8H2O): C, 45.04; H, 4.30; N, 5.30; found: C, 45.33, H, 4.47, N, 5.03. To determine the valence state of Fe, the as-synthesized crystals of 3 (10.0 mg) were digested by H2SO4 (1.0 mL, 1.0 mol L−1), to which an aqueous solution of K3[Fe(CN)6] (10.0 mL, 0.1 mol L−1) was added and stirred for 20 min. The reaction was carried out under N2 protection.
