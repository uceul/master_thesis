A mixture of Al2O3·3H2O (0.156 g), H3PO3 (0.164 g), terephthalic acid (0.166 g) and N,N-dimethylformamide (5.0 ml) was sealed in a Teflon-lined steel autoclave and heated at 170 °C for 5 days. After cooling to room temperature, colorless crystals of 3 and a small amount of unidentified powder impurities were recovered. Although terephthalic acid was not incorporated in the final framework, the presence of it in the reaction system seems to be important. All our attempts to prepare single crystals of compound 3 without the use of terephthalic acid failed.
