  Solvothermal treatment of HL (25.4 mg, 0.1 mmol), Co(ClO4)2·6H2O (33.3 mg, 0.1 mmol), NaOH (4.0 mg, 0.1 mmol), and H2O (2 ml), CH3CH2OH (8 ml) in a Teflon lined stainless steel container was performed for 3 d at 160 °C, red block crystalline products of 2 were collected by filtration and washed by water and ethanol several times. The yield of 2 was about 70% based on the amount of Co(ClO4)2·6H2O consumed. Anal. calcd for C13H13ClCoN4O8 (%): C, 34.88; H, 2.93; N, 12.52; found: C, 34.56; H, 2.89; N, 12.32.
