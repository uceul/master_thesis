Tb(NO3)3·6H2O (0.5 mmol), H2OBA (1.0 mmol), and NaCl (0.5 mmol) were added to a mixture of DMF (6.0 mL) and ethanol (6.0 mL). The mixture was heated in a 23 mL Teflon-lined autoclave at 150 °C for 3 days and then slowly cooled to 50 °C. Light-yellow needlelike crystals of 4 were obtained in the final product (yield: 96%, based on H2OBA). Calcd for C29.2H21.8N0.4O11.9TbNa (750.6): C, 46.73; H, 2.93; N, 0.75. Found: C, 43.76; H, 2.90; N, 0.85. IR bands (cm−1): 3586 mbr(O−H), 3173 m(C−H), 1635 m(C═O), 1598 s(C═C), 1524 s(N−H)bend, 1413 s(C═C), 1251 s(C−O), 1155 m(C−O), 882 m and 780 m(CH)oop.
