A mixture of Mn(NO3)2·4H2O (0.3 mmol), Iptp (0.075 mmol), H2tpa (0.1 mmol) and 10 mL DMF were sealed in a Teflon-lined reactor, the reactor was heated at 120 °C for 72 h and then cooled to room temperature at a rate of 5 °C h–1. Dark brown crystals of complex 2 were obtained. Yield: 23% (based on Iptp), Anal. Calcd for C84H74Mn3N14O16: C, 59.33; H, 4.38; N, 11.53%. Found: C, 59.75; H, 3.97; N, 11.98%.
