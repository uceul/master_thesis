 A mixture of Cd(NO3)2·4H2O (1 mmol), Co(dien)2Cl3 (0.40 mmol), K2C2O4·H2O (2 mmol) and H2O (10 mL) was added to a 20 mL Teflon-lined reactor under autogenous pressure at 120 °C for 3 days. The autoclave was then cooled to room temperature. Yellow rod-shaped crystals of compound 3 were obtained along with colorless block crystals and brown rod-shaped crystals.
