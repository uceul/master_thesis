A mixture of H8TDM (0.05 g, 6.3 × 10–5 mol), CuBr2 (0.15 g, 6.7 × 10–4 mol), and 1 mL of tetrafluoroboric acid (HBF4, 48% min w/w aqueous solution) in 17 mL of dimethylformamide (DMF) was sealed in a 20 mL borosilicate glass scintillation vial and placed in an oven at 60 °C for 72 h. The resulting green crystals of Cu4(H2O)4(TDM)·xS (PCN-26·xS, S = noncoordinated solvent molecules) were washed with DMF and collected.
