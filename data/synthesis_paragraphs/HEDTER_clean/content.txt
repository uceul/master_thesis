A mixture of Ni(NO3)2·6H2O (30.0 mg, 0.1 mmol), TPPA (47.6 mg, 0.1 mmol), and trans-1,4-cyclohexanedicarboxylic acid (17.2 mg, 0.1 mmol) was dissolved in 15 mL of DMF/MeCN/H2O (1/1/2). The final mixture was placed in a Parr Teflon-lined stainless steel vessel (25 mL) under autogenous pressure and heated at 95 °C for 3 days. Green crystals of 4 were collected in 52% yield (based on TPPA ligand). Calcd for NiC41H44N4O9: C, 61.90%; H, 5.58%; N, 7.04%. Found: C, 61.81%; H, 5.53%; N, 7.01%. IR(KBr, cm–1): 3411 (s), 2926 (w), 1667 (m), 1603 (s), 1487 (s), 1412 (m), 1323(m), 1226(m), 1007 (w), 910 (w), 818 (m), 752 (m), 522 (m).
