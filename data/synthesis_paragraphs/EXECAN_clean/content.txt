Zn(Ac)2·6H2O (0.100 g, 0.30 mmol), H4tptc (0.040 g, 0.10 mmol), apy (0.010 g, 0.10 mmol), DMA (5 mL), and H2O (1 mL) was stirred and added dropwise (10 drops) into a HNO3 solution (6 mol/L). White block crystals of 1 were obtained after 5 days at 100 °C (75.6% yield). Anal. Calcd (%) for C25.7H14.8N2Zn2O8.5 (1): C, 49.92; H, 2.41; N, 4.53. Found: C, 49.95; H, 2.38; N, 4.55.
