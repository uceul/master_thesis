An amount of 0.025 g (0.097 mmol) of 2-hydroxybiphenyl-4,4′-dicarboxylic acid (H2(BPDC–OH)), 0.023 g (0.097 mmol) of biphenyl-4,4′-dicarboxylic acid (H2BPDC), and 0.181 g (0.5 mmol) of Zn(NO3)2·6H2O was dissolved in a 20 mL scintillation vial containing 10 mL of DMF and three drops of H2O. The vial was heated at 368 K for 16 h; small, colorless cubic crystals were formed. Yield: 50% based on H2(BPDC–OH).
