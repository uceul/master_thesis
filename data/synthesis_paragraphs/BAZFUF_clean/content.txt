A solid mixture of H3BTB (21 mg, 0.048 mmol), and Cu(NO3)2·2.5H2O (60 mg, 0.258 mmol) was dissolved in a mixture of DMF/NMP/pyridine (5.0/5.0/0.4 mL) in a 20 mL vial. The vial was capped and heated in an isothermal oven at 85 °C for 48 h to give small blue cubic crystals. The reaction mixture was allowed to cool naturally to room temperature, and the crystals were washed with dimethylformamide (DMF) and dried in air. Yield: 16.9 mg, 33% based on H3BTB.
