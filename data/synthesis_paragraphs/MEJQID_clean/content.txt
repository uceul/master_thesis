 The mixture of Zn(NO3)2 (0.5 mmol, 0.150 g), adenine (0.5 mmol, 0.070 g), isonicotinic acid (0.5 mmol, 0.06 g), DMA (3 ml), dmurea (2 g) and MeOH (3 ml) was sealed in a 20 ml vial and heated to 120 °C for 3 days, and then cooled to room-temperature. The colorless crystals were obtained in pure phase, washed with water and ethanol, and dried at room temperature (yield: 70%). Anal. Calcd for C15H17N7O3Zn (408.73): C, 44.08; H, 4.19; N, 23.99.
