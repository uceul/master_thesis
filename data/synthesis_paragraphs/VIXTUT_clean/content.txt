A mixture of muconic acid (28.4 mg, 0.2 mmol), Zn(NO3)2·6H2O (59.0 mg, 0.2 mmol), 1,2-bis(4-pyridyl)ethane (73.7 mg, 0.4 mmol), and dimethylformamide (20 mL) was placed in a Teflon-lined high pressure bomb, which was sealed and heated at 85 °C for 72 h followed by cooling to room temperature. Suitable crystals of 6 for X-ray analysis were obtained. The yield of 6 was 38.0 mg (23%). The purity of a bulk sample of 6 was checked by PXRD (see Figure S5 in Supporting Information). IR (KBr): ν(cm–1) = 3399(brs), 1620(s), 1559(s), 1380(s), 1293(m), 1192(w), 1005(s), 866(m), 737(m), 704(w). Anal. Calcd. for C36H40N4O12Zn2 (851.46), 6: C, 50.78; H, 4.74; N, 6.58. Found: C, 50.66; H, 4.71; N, 6.45%.
