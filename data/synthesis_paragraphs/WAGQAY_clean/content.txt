The solvothermal synthesis of DUT‐9 can be performed in DMF as well as in DEF. The crystal structure of DUT‐9 was determined from a crystal grown in DMF. Further analytical investigations were performed with material obtained from a reaction carried out in DEF. For a typical synthesis, H3btb (180 mg, 0.41 mmol) and Ni(NO3)2⋅6 H2O (366 mg, 1.26 mmol) were dissolved in DEF (10.5 mL). The solution was heated in a Pyrex tube at 120 °C for 20 h. The resulting pale green crystals of DUT‐9 were collected by filtration under argon, washed twice with DEF, and dried in an argon flow at room temperature. Yield: 412 mg (54 % with respect to the amount of H3btb used).
