 A mixture of Zn(OAc)2·2H2O (0.0219 g, 0.1 mmol), KH2TDA (0.0314 g, 0.16 mmol) and azopy (0.0184 g, 0.1 mmol) was dissolved in H2O (8 mL). The mixture was sealed in a 25 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel reactor, heated at 90 °C for 72 h and then cooled to room temperature at the speed of 1 °C h−1. Red block crystals of 2 in ca. 32% yield (based on Zn) were collected by washing with distilled water and dried in air. Anal. calcd. for C33H22N16O13Zn3 (%): C 37.57, H 2.86, N 21.24. Found (%): C 37.42, H 2.22, N, 20.68. IR (KBr, cm−1): 3390 (m), 3201 (m), 1599 (vs), 1568 (s), 1410 (vs), 1281 (w), 1221 (m), 1015 (w), 842 (m), 706 (w).
