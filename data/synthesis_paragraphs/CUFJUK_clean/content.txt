Co3(OH)2(tpta)(H2O)4 (1). A mixture of Co(NO3)2 (0.116 g, 0.40 mmol), H4tpta (0.042 g, 0.10 mmol), HClO4 (0.15 mL/3 M, 0.45 mmol), DMF (3 mL), and H2O (4 mL) was stirred and then sealed in a 15 mL Teflon-lined stainless autoclave at 150 °C for 4 days. After it was cooled to room temperature and subjected to filtration, pink pillar crystals of 1 in a yield of 78.6% (based on H4tpta) were recovered. Anal. Calcd (%) for C22H20Co3O14 (1): C, 38.56; H, 2.94. Found: C, 38.35; H, 2.83. IR data (KBr, cm–1): 3566(s), 2960(b), 1584(s), 1410(s), 1150(w), 774(s), 586(s).
