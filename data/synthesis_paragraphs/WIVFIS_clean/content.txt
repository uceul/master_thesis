Compound 1 was prepared under hydrothermal condition. The mixtures of H3PMo12O40 · 12H2O (0.3 g, 0.17 mmol), AgNO3 (0.17 g, 1.00 mmol), ptz (0.065 g, 0.49 mmol) were dissolved in 10 mL of distilled water at room temperature. When the pH value adjusted to about 1.7 with 1.0 mol·L− 1 HNO3, the suspension was put into a Teflon-lined autoclave and kept under autogenous pressure at 170oC for 3 days. After slow cooling to room temperature (final pH = 2.5), red block crystals were filtered and washed with distilled water (54% yield based on Mo). Anal.
