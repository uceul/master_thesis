 A mixture of CuSO4·5H2O (8 mg, 0.03 mmol), H2L (5 mg, 0.015 mmol), N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) (2 mL) and HNO3 (0.05 mL) (2.2 mL HNO3 in 10 mL DMF) was sealed in a 20 mL vial and heated at 85 °C for 24 h. Green block crystals were collected and air-dried (yield 62%, based on H2L). Elemental analysis (%) calcd for JLU-Liu39 [(CH3)2NH2]2[Cu3O(SO4)3Cu2L2(DMF)(H2O)]·9DMF: C, 41.23; H, 5.286; N, 9.35; Found: C, 39.27; H, 5.23; N, 9.29. The experimental PXRD pattern is in good agreement with the simulated one based on the single-crystal X-ray data, indicating the purity of the as-synthesized product (Fig. S1).
