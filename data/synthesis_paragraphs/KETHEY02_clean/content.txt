 A mixture of Cd(NO3)2·6H2O (30.8 mg, 0.10 mmol), H2L(24.3 mg, 0.10 mmol), 5-amino-benzene-1,2,3-tricarboxylic acid (22.5 mg, 0.10 mmol), and DMF (3 mL) was sealed in a parr Teflon-lined stainless steel vessel (25 cm3) and heated at 120 °C for 2 days. After slowly cooling to room temperature, light brown crystals of 1 were isolated (yield: 75% based on Cd). Anal. Calcd for C16H14CdN2O5: C, 45.04; H, 3.31; N, 6.57%; found: C, 45.08; H, 3.39; N, 6.51%. IR spectrum (cm−1): 3411m, 1658s, 1613s, 1566s, 1504w, 1443s, 1416s, 1368s, 1294w, 1102w, 1072w, 840w, 779m, 731s, 644m, 511w.
