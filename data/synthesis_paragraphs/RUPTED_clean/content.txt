 A mixture of CuI (0.086 g, 0.4 mmol), pyrazine-2,3-dicarboxylic acid (0.05 g, 0.3 mmol), acetonitrile (3 mL), water (5 mL) and acetic acid (6 drops) was sealed in a Teflon-lined autoclave and heated under autogenous pressure at 140 °C for three days. After cooling to room temperature, brown block-shaped crystals of 1 were obtained and washed with acetonitrile twice. Yield: 65%. IR (KBr, cm−1): 3335 (s), 1674 (vs), 1594 (s), 1459 (w), 1412 (s), 1322 (s), 1174 (m), 1157 (m), 1059 (m), 864 (w), 790 (w), 740 (vw), 478 (m). Elemental anal. (%).
