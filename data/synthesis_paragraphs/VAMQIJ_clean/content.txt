Synthesis. (CN3H6)2·(VO2)3(PO4)(HPO4) was prepared from a mixture of 0.875 g of guanidinium carbonate [(C(NH2)3)2CO3], 2.240 g of 85% H3PO4, 0.883 g of V2O5, 1.245 g of Mg(NO3)2, and 7 mL of deionized water (starting molar ratio of guanidine:V:P ≈ 1:2:4). The metal precursors were mixed in water, acid was added next, and then the organic component. The mixture, enclosed in a 23-mL Parr Teflon-lined hydrothermal bomb filled approximately to the 50% level, was then heated to 120 °C for 2 days. After the mixture was slowly cooled, the solid product, consisting of 1.503 g of green-yellow crystals and powder (yield based on V = 83%) was recovered from the supernatant liquors by filtration. Reactions which omitted the magnesium nitrate did not produce any (CN3H6)2·(VO2)3(PO4)(HPO4) and led to an unidentified yellow powder. Reactions in which zinc oxide replaced magnesium nitrate in the starting mixture led to a mixed-phase product containing some crystals of (CN3H6)2·(VO2)3(PO4)(HPO4) and other unidentified phases.
