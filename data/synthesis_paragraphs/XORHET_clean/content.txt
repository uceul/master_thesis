 CoSO4·7H2O (0.028 g, 0.1 mmol) and H2pzbtz (0.011 g, 0.05 mmol) were mixed in H2O (8 mL) in a 25 mL vessel. The mixture was sealed and heated at 105 °C for 72 h and then cooled to room temperature at a rate of 0.1 °C min−1. Yellow sheet crystals of 4 were obtained in 69% yield (based on H2pzbtz). Anal. Calcd for C16H14CoN16O2: C, 36.86; H, 2.71; N, 42.99%. Found: C, 36.79; H, 2.77; N, 42.94%.
