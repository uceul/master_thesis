The compound [Ho2(C4H4O4)3(H2O)2]·0.33(C7H6O3)(1) was obtained by hydrothermal reaction of 0.5 mmol of Ho(NO3)3·5H2O with 0.75 mmol of succinylsalicylic acid (H2C18H12O8) in 10 mL of distilled water, adjusting the pH to 5.5 with 0.2 mL of triethylamine (TEA). The mixture was placed in a Teflon-lined digestion bomb of 43 mL internal volume, heated for 65 h at 160 °C, and then cooled to room temperature. Small crystals were obtained as light brown needles, which were separated by filtration, washed with distilled water and acetone, and dried at ambient conditions.
