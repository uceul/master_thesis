The title compound 1 was hydrothermally synthesized under autogenous pressure. A mixture of CoCl2·6H2O (1.0 g), Na2MoO4·2H2O (1.8 g), H3PO4 (0.8 ml), and water (12 ml) was neutralized to pH 8.5 with ethylenediamine (30%) under continuous stirring and sealed in a 25 ml Teflon-lined autoclave, which was heated to 175 °C for four days. After slow cooling to room temperature, black block crystals of 1 were separated as a major phase (75% yield based on Co) together with a small amount of an unidentified black powder. Anal. Calc. For 1: C, 8.34; H, 3.20; N, 9.73; P, 8.62; Co, 12.28; Mo, 26.66%. Found: C, 8.45; H, 3.32; N, 9.81; P, 8.55; Co, 12.17; Mo, 26.78%. The IR spectrum of 1 exhibited complex bands at 1096, 982, 952, 879, 829, and 727
