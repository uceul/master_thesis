 A mixture of Gd(NO3)3·6H2O (270 mg, 0.6 mmol) and H2fum (522 mg, 4.5 mmol) in 9 mL of H2O was sealed in a 25 mL Teflon-lined autoclave, and heated to 140 °C for 2 days. After the autoclave was cooled to room temperature in 48 h, block colorless crystals were collected with ∼35% yield based on GdIII. Anal. calcd for C5H10GdO10: C, 15.50; H, 2.60%. Found: C, 15.96; H, 2.80%. The IR spectrum is shown in Fig. S5b (ESI).
