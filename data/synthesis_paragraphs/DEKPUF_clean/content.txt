In a typical synthesis of 1, a reaction mixture of ZnO (0.36 g) and NiCl2·6H2O (0.79 g) were first dissolved in H2O (10 mL), and then DACH (1.00 mL) was added with stirring under ambient conditions. Finally, H3PO3 (0.545 g) was added to the above reaction mixture. A homogeneous gel with a pH value about 6.5 was formed after stirring for 2 h. The mixture was sealed in a teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave and heated at 160 °C for 5 days under static condition. The solid product consisting of large single crystals in the form of yellow prisms was obtained by filtration, washed by distilled water and then dried in the oven at 100 °C. The ICP and elemental analysis results of 1 were consistent with the theoretical values based on the crystal data. Calc: Zn, 27.05; Ni, 6.07; P, 16.02; C, 14.91; H, 3.65; N, 5.80 wt%.
