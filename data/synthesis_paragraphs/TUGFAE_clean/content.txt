The polymer was synthesized by hydrothermal methods. A mixture of Ni(NO3)2·6 H2O (0.3 mmol), 1,4-H2NDC (0.1 mmol), 4,4′-dpdo (0.1 mmol), NaOH (0.2 mmol) and distilled water (15 mL) was stirred for 1 h. The mixture was then transferred to a 25 mL Teflon-lined steel autoclave and kept at 160 °C for five days under autogenous pressure. After the mixture had been slowly cooled down to room temperature, brown block crystals were obtained. Yield: ca. 69%. Anal. Calcd(%) for C34H28Ni2N2O14: C, 50.67; H, 3.50; N, 3.48.
