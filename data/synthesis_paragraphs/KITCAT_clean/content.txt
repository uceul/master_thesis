 A mixture of KAg(CN)2 (199 mg, 1 mmol) and Me4NBr (103 mg, 0.67 mmol) in 10 mL of dry and distilled THF solvent was sealed into a 25 mL polytetrafluoroethylene-lined stainless steel container under autogenous pressure and heated at 100 °C for 3 days, The resultant solution was filtered off into a small tube, which was loaded into a large vial containing 5 mL diethyl ether. The large vial was sealed and left undisturbed at room temperature, and colorless crystals of 1 were collected in ca. 40% yield (based on silver) in one week.
