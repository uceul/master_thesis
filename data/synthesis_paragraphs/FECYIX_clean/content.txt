 Cobalt(II) chloride hexahydrate CoCl2·6H2O (1.10 g, 4.6 mmol) and H2L-RR (0.41 g, 2.3 mmol) were dissolved in 7 mL of deionized water. The resulting clear purple solution was transferred to a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave, sealed and heated under autogeneous pressure at 90 °C for 24 h. After slow overnight cooling, purple crystals of 1 were collected, washed with fresh ethanol (4 × 10 mL), petroleum ether (40–60 °C boiling fraction, 4 × 10 mL) and finally dried under a nitrogen stream at room temperature. Yield: 0.065 g (10.5%, calculated with respect to the ligand). The phase purity was checked through XRPD, comparing the experimental diffractogram with that calculated from the single-crystal structure.
