A mixture of Zn(UO2)(OAc)4·7H2O (40 mg, 0.04 mmol), H4L aqueous solution (118 mg, 0.29 mmol), bi (20 mg, 0.169 mmol), and deionized water (1.0 mL) was loaded into a 20-mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave. The autoclave was sealed and heated at 160 °C for 2 days and then cooled to room temperature. Yellow crystals were isolated, yield 10 mg (45% based on uranium) initial pH 1.8, final pH 2.0. EDS results indicated the presence of U/Zn/P (∼2:1:4). Elemental analysis observed (Calcd): C 10.89% (10.95%); H 2.53% (2.40%); N 2.57% (2.32%).
