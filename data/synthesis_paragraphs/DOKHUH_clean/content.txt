 A mixture of Cd(NO3)2·4H2O (20 mg, 0.06 mmol), H3TMBTC (10 mg, 0.05 mmol) and 4,4′-bpy (10 mg, 0.06 mmol) was suspended in the mixed solution of H2O (8 ml) and EtOH (8 ml), and heated in a Teflon-lined steel bomb at 180 °C for 3 d. The colorless crystals of 3 were collected, washed with water and dried in the air (yield: 45%). Elemental analysis calcd (%) for 3: C 38.72, H 4.16, N 7.06; found: C 37.53, H 4.64, N 7.59%.
