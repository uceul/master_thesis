H2(bdc-Cl2) (470 mg, 2.0 mmol), Zn(NO3)2·6H2O (595 mg, 2.0 mmol), and dabco (112 mg, 1.0 mmol) were mixed in DMF (30 mL) and homogenized by stirring for 5 min. The solution was heated to 120 °C in a Teflon autoclave for 48 h to obtain white crystals. For elemental analysis these crystals were collected and dried in vacuo at 140 °C for 1 h to afford [Zn2(bdc-Cl2)2(dabco)]n (4) (313 mg, 44%). Elemental analysis calcd for C22H16Cl4N2O8Zn2 (708.96): C, 37.27; H, 2.27; N, 3.95. Found: C, 37.75; H, 2.32; N, 3.86.
