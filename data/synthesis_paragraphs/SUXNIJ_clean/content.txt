A reaction mixture of VOSO4 (1 mmol), H3BO3 (1.5 mmol), H3PO3 (6 mmol), cyclohexylamine (cha, 5 mmol), and H2O (5 mL) was placed in a Teflon-lined digestion bomb (internal volume = 23 mL) and heated at 180 °C under autogenous pressure for 72 h and slowly cooled to room temperature at 6 °C h−1. The reaction yielded light green hexagonal plate-like crystals of 1 as a major phase product. By changing the ratio of V:B in a step-wise manner from the original 1:1.5 to the final 0.5:5, a mono-phased product of 1 was obtained in a yield of 65% (based on vanadium). Single-crystal structure analysis was performed to determine the 3D structure and chemical formula. The trivalent state for all three vanadium sites in 1 was confirmed by its green color, results from bond-valence-sum (BVS) calculations, observed magnetic moments, and EPR and XANES spectra (vide infra). It was noted that no trivalent vanadium oxysalts reported so far have been prepared from tetravalent vanadium. This is owing to the fact that the reduction of tetravalent vanadyl VO2+ into V3+ in acidic solution is much less favorable than the reduction of pentavalent vanadyl VO2+. It is unprecedented that successful conversion of VO2+ into V3+ was achievable in the above reactions with pH value = 2 ∼ 3. We presumed that the type of cyclic alkylamine, cha, carried adequate reducing power to make the conversion of VO2+ into V3+ possible. Thereafter, we employed several amines of this type and found reduced products as expected. With the cycloheptylamine (chpa), which is of comparable size to cha, we obtained a second 16R-channel structure of trivalent VPO that is isotypic with 1. The strategy of adopting a cyclic alkylamine with suitable strength in reduction power effectively achieves the reduction of V4+ to V3+ in acidic solution, which would not occur otherwise.
