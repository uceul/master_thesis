 A mixture of CuCl2·2H2O (0.034 g, 0.2 mmol), Hcpt (0.020 g, 0.1 mmol), H2O (4 mL) and CH3CN (2 mL) was added into a 25 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel reactor, and then heated at 120 °C for 3 days under autogenous pressure. After cooling to room temperature, green long block crystals were obtained. The yield was 75% for 2 (based on Hcpt). Elemental analysis calcd (%) for 2 (C62H60Cl10Cu8N22O18): C 32.89, H 2.67, N 13.61; found: C 32.84, H 2.89, N 13.26.
