Synthesis of [H2N(CH2CH2)2NH2][V4O2F4(H2O)2{O3P(CH2)3PO3}2] (1). A mixture of NH4VO3 (0.219 g, 1.872 mmol), 1,3-propylenediphosphonic acid (0.192 g, 0.941 mmol), H2O (10.00 g, 556 mmol), piperazine (0.178 g, 1.433 mmol), and HF (0.350 mL, 10.14 mmol) in the mole ratio of 1.99:1.00:591:1.52:10.8 was stirred briefly before heating to 200 Â°C for 48 h. Initial and final pH values of 2.5 and 3.0, respectively, were recorded. Dark green crystals of 1 suitable for X-ray diffraction were isolated in 55% yield. IR (KBr pellet, cm-1):  3410(b), 2931(w), 1617(m), 1508(w), 1466(w), 1401(w), 1257(m), 1068(m), 1025(s), 774(m), 724(m), 613(m). Anal. Calcd for C5H14F2NO8P2V2 (Found):  F, 9.09 (8.50).
