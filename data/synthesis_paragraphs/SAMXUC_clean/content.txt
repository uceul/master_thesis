0.5 mmol of Sm2O3 and 2.0 mmol of 6,6-dimethyl-3-oxabicyclo[3.1.0]hexane-2,4-dione were mixed in 12.0 mL of H2O and stirred for 15 min at room temperature, generating an aqueous suspension. Then, the aqueous suspension was transferred into a Teflon-lined stainless-steel vessel (23 mL) and heated at 210 °C for 5 days under the autogenous pressure. After the reaction mixture was slowly cooled down to room temperature, yellowish blocklike single crystals of UJN-Sm4 were filtered off (Figures S1 and S2), washed with ultrapure water, and dried in air (yields: ∼ 15%).
