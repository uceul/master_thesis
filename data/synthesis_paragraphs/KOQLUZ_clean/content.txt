 A mixture of H4[SiW12O40] (300 mg), bib (80 mg), Cu(NO3)2 (160 mg) and (CH3)4NOH (4 mmol) was dissolved in 10 ml of distilled water at room temperature. The pH value was adjusted to about 2.8 with 2.0 M HCl and then the solution was kept at 170 Â°C for 4 days. The reactor was then slowly cooled to room temperature over a period of 13 h. Green block crystals of 3 were obtained (28% yield based on Cu). Elemental analysis found: C 8.46, H 0.81, N 3.27, Cu 1.87%; calc. for 1, C24H26N8CuSiW12O42 (3396.20): C 8.48, H 0.76, N 3.30, Cu 1.88%.
