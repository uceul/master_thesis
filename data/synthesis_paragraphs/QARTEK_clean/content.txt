[Cd3(ppa)2(bpdc)2(H2O)2]·5H2O (2): A mixture of Cd(OAc)2·2H2O (0.213 g, 0.8 mmol), pipemidic acid (0.121 g, 0.4 mmol), H2bpdc (0.097 g, 0.4 mmol), NH4F (0.044 g, 1.2 mmol), and water (8 mL) was adjusted to pH = 10.5 with a KOH solution (2.5 M) and then sealed in an 18‐mL Teflon‐liner autoclave, which was heated at 130 °C for 3 d and then cooled to room temperature. Light yellow block crystals of 2 were filtered, washed with distilled water, and dried in air (yield 64 % based on Cd). It is noteworthy that the reagent NH4F is rather important in the formation of 2; if there is only a small amount or if it is removed, no single crystals but only a light yellow microcrystalline product would be obtained. C56H62Cd3N10O21 (1548.36): calcd. C 43.44, H 4.04, Cd 21.78, N 9.05; found C 43.65, H 4.24, Cd 21.95, N 9.23.
