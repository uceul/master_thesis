 Preparation of IFMC-1: Zn(NO3)2·6H2O (0.15 g, 0.50 mmol) was added to a solution of H3L (0.10 g, 0.50 mmol) in DMA (5 mL) with stirring. The mixture was heated at 95 °C for 3 d and then cooled to room temperature. Colorless block crystals were collected and dried in air (yield 85%, based on Zn(NO3)2·6H2O). Elemental analysis: Anal. calc.: C 27.02; H 2.83; N 47.26; Zn 18.39. Found: C 26.95; H 2.89; N 47.30; Zn 18.35%. IR (KBr, cm−1, Fig. S11, ESI): 3439 (m), 2938 (m), 1929 (m), 1606 (s), 1436 (s), 1261 (m), 1175 (m), 1066 (m), 1030 (s), 1004 (m), 971 (m), 942 (m), 752 (m), 683 (w), 608 (m), 506 (s).
