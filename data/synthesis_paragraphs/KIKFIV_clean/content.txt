 A solution of Eu(NO3)3·3H2O (0.030 g) in 1 mL of 2 mol L−1 HNO3 was mixed with ligand (H2L) (0.015 g ) in 10 mL of DMF/5 mL of H2O. The mixture was sealed in a Pyrex tube and heated to 85 °C for 4 d. The red block-shaped crystals obtained were filtered and washed with DMF. The yield of the reaction was ca. 36% based on the ligand. Anal. calcd for C54H46EuO12N2: H 4.35%, C 60.79%, N 2.63%; found: H 3.95%, C 59.875%, N 3.14%. IR: 3429, 1607, 1466, 1384, 1170, 1072, 1018, 857, 760.
