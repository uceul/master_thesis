A mixture of Na2MoO4·2H2O (1.452 g, 6.00 mmol), Co(CH3COO)2·4H2O (0.480 g, 2.52 mmol), 4,4′-bipyridine (0.400 g, 2.70 mmol), H3PO4 (2 mL, 30 mmol), and pyridine (0.350 g, 4.42 mmol) was dissolved in 36 mL of water. The mixture was stirred for 0.5 h at room temperature and the pH adjusted to 2.5 with 1 M NaOH. The resulting suspension was sealed in a 50-mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave and heated at 165 °C for 5 days. After cooling to room temperature, the deep-red block crystals were isolated. The crystals were filtered, washed with distilled water, and dried at room temperature with a yield of 45% (based on Co). Anal.
