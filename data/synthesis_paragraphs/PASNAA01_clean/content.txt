Preparation of 1: A mixture of CoCl2·6H2O (357 mg, 1.50 mmol), NaOH (60 mg, 1.50 mmol), C6H6(COOH)6·H2O, H6L (92 mg, 0.25 mmol), and 6 mL of H2O was stirred in air for 0.5 h. The resulting solution was heated in a stainless steel reactor with Teflon liner at 100 °C for 2 days. After a period of approximately 24 h cooling to room temperature, purple block crystals of single-phase products for 1 were collected, washed with H2O, and dried in air. Yields: 52%.
