A mixture of Cd(NO3)·4H2O (0.06 g, 0.2 mmmol), H2tdc (0.034 g, 0.2 mmol), bpp (0.038 g, 0.2 mmol) and DMA (3 mL) was seal in a Teflon–lined stainless steel reactor under autogenous pressure at 120 °C for 72 h and then cooled to room temperature slowly. Colorless prism crystals of 1 were obtained in 43% yield based on Cd(NO3)·4H2O. Elemental analyses for C29H27N3O9S2Cd2 (850.48): Calcd. (%) C, 40.92; H, 3.17; N, 4.94. Found (%): C, 40.95; H, 3.23; N, 4.99%.
