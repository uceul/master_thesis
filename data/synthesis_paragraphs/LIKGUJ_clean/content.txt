Synthesis of [Cu3(L1)2(H2O)3]⋅2 DMF⋅5.5 H2O (ZJU‐35): H3L1 (20 mg, 0.085 mmol), Cu(NO3)2⋅3H2O (40 mg, 0.17 mmol), 0.1 M HCl (2.8 mL), DMF (20 mL), and H2O (12 mL) were mixed and heated at 65 °C for two days. Blue crystals of ZJU‐35 were collected by filtration, washed with EtOH and Et2O, and dried in air. Yield: 75 %; IR (KBr pellet): =1652 (s), 1614 (m), 1560 (m), 1497 (w), 1440 (m), 1378 (s), 1262 (m), 1107 (w), 984 (w), 874 (w), 777 (m), 730 (m), 628 cm−1 (w); elemental analysis calcd (%) for C28H41N2Cu3O22.5: C 35.17, H 4.32, N 2.93; found: C 35.13, H 4.15, N 2.87
