Three drops of aqueous H3PO3 (50 %) were added to a mixture of Zn(NO3)2⋅6 H2O (0.12 g, 0.40 mmol) and HL (0.05 g, 0.60 mmol) in DMF (5 mL) with stirring. The mixture was heated at 85 °C for 72 h and then cooled to room temperature. Colorless crystals (0.07 g) were collected and dried in air (80 % yield based on Zn(NO3)2⋅6 H2O). IR (KBr, Figure S4, Supporting Information): =3503 (w), 2373 (w), 1621 (m), 1505 (s), 1400 (s), 1283 (w), 1119 (s), 1020 (s), 695 (m), 563 (m), and 413 cm−1 (s); elemental anal. calcd (%) for C6H12.67N12O3.33P0.67Zn2 (457.67): C 15.75, H 2.79, N 36.73; found: C 15.63, H 2.85, N 36.59.
