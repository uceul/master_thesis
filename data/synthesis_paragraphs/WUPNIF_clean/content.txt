‡ Synthesis of [Na2(H2O)10]n[CuZn4(μ3-OH)4(btec)2]n·2nH2O (1). A mixture of ZnCl2 (0.544 g, 4.0 mmol), Cu(NO3)2·3H2O (0.241 g, 1.0 mmol), H4btec (0.254, 1.0 mmol) and Na2CO3 (0.32 g, 3.0 mmol) in H2O (18 ml) was heated at 160 °C for 60 h under autogeneous pressure. After the reaction mixture was slowly cooled to room temperature, sky-blue crystals were produced and then washed with water and ethanol (yield 46%, based on Zn). Anal. Calcd. for C20H32CuNa2O32Zn4 (%): C, 20.79; H, 2.79. Found: C, 20.85; H, 2.81. Zn:Cu = 4:1 (mol mol−1). IR (solid KBr pellet v/cm−1): 3552m, 3421m, 1594s, 1385s, 1141m, 870m, 812m.
