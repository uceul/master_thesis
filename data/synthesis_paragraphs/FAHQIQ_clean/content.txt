 A mixture of In(NO3)3 (0.0609 g), H2BPDA (0.0968 g), and phen (0.0199 g) with a molar ratio of 2:4:1 was mixed in H2O (5 mL) and N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) (5 mL). After stirring for half an hour in air, it was transferred into a 15 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave and heated at 160 °C for three days. The mixture was washed with distilled water and colorless octahedral block crystals were filtered off and dried at room temperature (yield 51% based on In). The ICP and elemental analyses: Calcd. for C30H26InNO9 (%): In, 17.41; C, 54.60; N, 2.12; H, 3.94. Found: In, 17.40; C, 54.63; N, 2.14; H, 3.92. IR data (KBr cm−1): 3420(m), 3066(m), 1660(m), 1607(s), 1538(m), 1404(s), 1176(m), 1105(w), 1005(m), 872(s), 770(s), 691(m), 525(w), 444(m).
