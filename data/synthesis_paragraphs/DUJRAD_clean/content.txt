A mixture of CuCl2·2H2O (0.1 mmol, 0.017 g), Ba(NO3)2 (0.1 mmol, 0.026 g), H2tdc (0.1 mmol, 0.017 g), and DMF (3 mL) was sealed in a small vial, which was kept at 100 °C for 60 h and finally cooled to the room temperature slowly. Green block crystals yield in 35 % based on H2tdc. C15H13BaCuNO10S2 (632.26): calcd. C 28.47; N 2.21; H 2.06 %; found: C 28.42; N 2.32; H 2.11 %.
