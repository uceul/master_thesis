A mixture of adenine (5 mg, 0.04 mmol), H4BTeC (10 mg, 0.04 mmol), and CoCO3 (10 mg, 0.08 mmol) in water (6 mL) was placed in a 12 mL scintillation vial and heated at 100 °C for 48 h. After slow cooling to room temperature during 6 h, pink crystals of 2 were obtained, filtered, and air-dried (25% yield). Elemental analysis, calculated (%): C: 28.6, H: 3.4, N: 11.1; found: C: 28.5, H: 3.3, N: 11.3. FT-IR (KBr, cm–1): 3300(sbr); 1682(m); 1593(s); 1490(s); 1379(sbr).
