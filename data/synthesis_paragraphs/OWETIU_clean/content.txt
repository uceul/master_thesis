A mixture of α-K6P2W18O62·15H2O (2 g, 0.4 mmol), AgNO3 (0.17 g, 1 mmol), bbi (0.4 g, 1 mmol), and NH4VO3 (0.12 g, 0.1 mmol) were dissolved in 10 mL of distilled water at room temperature. When the pH of the mixture was adjusted to about 7.1 with 1.0 mol L–1 NaOH, the suspension was put into a Teflon-lined autoclave and kept under autogenous pressure at 160 °C for 4 days. After slow cooling to room temperature, yellow block crystals were filtered and washed with distilled water (50% yield based on Ag). Anal. Calcd for C50H71Ag7N20O63P2W18 (6086.34): C 9.87, H 1.12, N 4.60. Found: C 9.89, H 1.15, N 4.64. IR (solid KBr pellet, cm–1): 3139 (w), 1690 (m), 1655 (m), 1519 (s), 1420 (w), 1344 (w), 1274 (w), 1225 (m), 1140 (w), 1087 (s), 954 (m), 909 (m), 783(s).
