Synthesis of [Ni(tpt)2/3(bpta)1/4(H2O)2(OH)]⋅solve (1). Ni(NO3)2⋅ 6H2O (58.2 mg, 0.2 mmol) was added to 18 mL 1:1 (v/v) mixture of methanol and water containing tpt (15.5 mg, 0.05 mmol) and H4bpta (16.5 mg,0.05 mmol) under stirring. The green suspension was then sealed in a 25 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel vessel and heated to 140 °C for 2 days. Upon cooling to room temperature, octahedron green crystals were obtained (ca. 40 mg, 50% yield based on Ni). Crystals of 1 were collected, washed with methanol, and dried in air. Anal. found: C, 42.24; H, 4.97; N, 8.66%.
