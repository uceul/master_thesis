Synthesis of 1: a mixture of Co(NO3)2·6H2O (204 mg, 0.7 mmol), 1,3-H2bdc (133 mg, 0.8 mmol), Hbta (81 mg, 0.68 mmol), and CH3CH2OH/CH3OH (8 mL, V:V = 6:2) were sealed in a 23 ml Teflonlined stainless steel container, which was heated at 120 °C for 3 days and then cooled to room temperature at a rate of 10 °C·h− 1. Purple block shaped crystals of 1 were collected. Yield: 26% based on Co. Elemental analysis for C41H38Co4N6O16 (Mr = 1106.50) (1): calcd: C 44.50, H 3.46, N 7.60 %; found: C 44.68, H 3.32, N 7.45 %.
