The title compound was prepared hydrothermally from a mixture of indium nitrate (In(NO3)3 · 4.5H2O, Shanghai Reagent Plant, 99.5%), phosphoric acid (Beijing Chemical Plant, 85 wt%), 4,4′-bipyridine (4,4′-bipy, Aldrich), hydrofluoric acid (Beijing Chemical plant, 40%) and distilled water with the molar ratio of In(NO3)3 · 4.5H2O:3.0 H3PO4:2.0-4,4′-bipy:7.0HF:555H2O. Typically, 0.35 g indium nitrate was first dispersed into 9 ml of H2O with stirring, and then 0.18 ml of H3PO4 and 0.3 ml HF were added successively with stirring, to form a clear solution. Finally, 0.34 g of 4,4′-bipy was added dropwise under vigorous stirring. The white gel thus formed was stirred until homogeneous. The final mixture was sealed in a Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave and heated at 180 °C for 8 days under autogenous pressure. The product (about 90% yield based on In source) consisting of colorless block-shaped crystals was separated by sonication, further washed with distilled water and dried at room temperature.
