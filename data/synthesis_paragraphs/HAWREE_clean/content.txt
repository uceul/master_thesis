A reaction mixture of Mn(CH3COO)2·4H2O (0.5 mmol, 0.123 g), H2btac (0.4 mmol, 0.065 g), DMF (4 mL), and EtOH (4 mL) was stirred for 20 min in air, then transferred and sealed in a 18-mL Teflon-lined autoclave, which was heated in an oven to 473 K for 72 h, followed by slow cooling (5 K h–1). The resulting light yellow crystals were washed with distilled water and dried in air (yield: ca. 33%). Elemental analysis calcd (%) for 1 C41H57Mn5N13O19: C, 37.57; H, 4.38; N, 13.89. Found: C, 37.83; H, 4.41; N, 13.68%. IR (KBr pellets, cm–1): 3429 (m), 1595 (s), 1558 (s), 1476 (w), 1401 (s), 1308 (vs), 1196 (s), 784 (s).
