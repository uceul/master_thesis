A mixture of NiCl2·6H2O (0.050 g, 0.2 mmol), NH4VO3 (0.047 g, 0.4 mmol) and bpp (0.030 g, 0.15 mmol) was dissolved in 8 mL of distilled water at room temperature. Then the pH value of the mixture was adjusted to about 3.0 with concentrated HNO3. Then the mixture was stirred for 30 min at room temperature and was sealed in a 15 mL Teflon reactor at 100 °C for 3 days. After slowly cooling to room temperature, green blocks of crystals 3 were filtered and washed with deionized water. Yield: 65% (based on Ni).
