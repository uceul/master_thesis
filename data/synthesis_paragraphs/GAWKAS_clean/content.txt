A mixture of Sm2O3 (0.174 g, 0.5 mmol), CuBr2 (0.223 g, 1 mmol), HIN (0.246 g, 2 mmol) and H2O (10 mL) was stirred at room temperature until a homogeneous mixture was obtained, and was adjusted to pH = 2 by the addition of HClO4 (0.035 g, 0.35 mmol). The mixture was transferred into a Teflon-line autoclave (23 mL) and heated at 180 °C for 5 days and then cooled at rate of 2 °C h− 1 to room temperature. Yellow block crystals of 1 were recovered by filtration, washed with distilled water, and dried in air (26% yield based on Sm). Anal. Calcd. for 1 (dried) (%): C, 22.68; H, 1.99; N, 4.41. Found: C, 22.43; H, 2.07; N, 4.62. Selected IR data (KBr pellet, cm− 1): 3426, 1614, 1538, 1418, 773, 705.
