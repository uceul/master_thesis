HNU-1 was prepared under hydrothermal condition. A mixture of 0.268 g Na2C2O4, 0.308 g Cd(NO3)2·4H2O, 0.1 g Co(NH3)6·Cl3, and 10 mL H2O was added to 25 mL Teflon-lined reactor under autogenous pressure at 100 °C for 4 days. The autoclave was then cooled to room temperature. Yellow rod-shaped crystals of HNU-1 were obtained. After isolated, the crystals of HNU-1 were washed with distilled water, and dried in air, with the yield of ∼50% based on Co(NH3)6Cl3. Anal. Calcd.
