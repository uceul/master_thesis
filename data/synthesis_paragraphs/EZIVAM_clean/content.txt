A mixture of SrCO3 (0.015 g, 0.10 mmol), H3BTPCA (0.047 g, 0.10 mmol), DMF (6 mL), EtOH (3 mL) was sealed in a Teflon-lined stainless steel vessel (15 mL), which was heated at 140 °C for 12 h and cooled to room temperature at a rate of 5 °C h−1. Colorless lamellar crystals of 1 were collected in 73% yield (0.041 g, based on BTPCA). Anal. Calcd for C21H27N6O7Sr: C, 44.79; H, 4.83%; N, 14.92%. Found: C, 44.73%; H, 4.90%; N, 14.83%.
