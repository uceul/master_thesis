‡ Synthesis of MOF 1: H3BPT (0.045 mmol, 13 mg), Yb(NO3)3·6H2O (0.045 mmol, 20 mg), DMF (2 mL), H2O (1.3 mL) and ethanol (2 mL) were placed in a 20 mL glass vial, which was sealed and heated to 80 °C for 48 h, and then cooled to room temperature. The colorless crystals formed were collected and air-dried (55% based on Yb(NO3)3·6H2O). Elemental analysis (%) calcd for Yb(BPT)(H2O)·(DMF)1.5(H2O)1.25: C 45.14; H 3.27; N 3.10. Found: C, 45.03; H, 3.19; N, 3.04.
