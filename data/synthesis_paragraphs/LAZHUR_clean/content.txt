A mixture of Co(NO3)2·4H2O (29.1 mg, 0.1 mmol), H2bdc (16.6 mg, 0.1 mmol), and TPOM (22.2 mg, 0.05 mmol) was dissolved in 9 mL DMF/H2O (1/2, v/v). The final mixture was placed in a Parr Teflon-lined stainless vessel and heated at 105 °C for 3 days. Purple block crystals were obtained. Yield of the reaction was ca. 64% based on TPOM. Anal. Calcd for C41H38Co2N4O17: C, 50.42%; H, 3.92%; N, 5.74%. Found: C, 50.57%; H, 3.81%; N, 5.69%.
