 Step 1: the precursor Na16[Mn4(H2O)2(P2W15O56)2]·53H2O cluster was prepared via a conventional method that has been previously reported in the literature. Step 2: a mixture of Na16[Mn4(H2O)2(P2W15O56)2]·53H2O (0.4839 g), dpdo (0.16 g), Ce(NO3)3·6H2O (0.15 g) and H2O (18 mL) was stirred and its pH value was ca. 4.0. The resulting suspension was sealed in a 30 mL Teflon lined reactor and kept at 160 °C for 4 days. After cooling the autoclave to room temperature, dark orange block crystals were separated, washed with water, and air-dried (Yield: 40% based on W). Calcd for Na2[Ce4(H2O)22(dpdo)5](Mn2HP2W15O56)2·8H2O (9740.94): C 6.17, H 1.06, N 1.44, Na 0.47, Mn 2.26, P 1.27, W 56.62, Ce 5.75; found: C 6.10, H 1.13, N 1.35, Na 0.40, Mn 2.18, P 1.36, W 56.72, Ce 5.83%.
