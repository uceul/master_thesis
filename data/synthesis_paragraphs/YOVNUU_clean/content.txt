A mixture of Ni(NO3)2·6H2O (0.1 mmol), tipb (0.1 mmol), H2atpa (0.2 mmol), and two drops of triethylamine in 5 mL of DMF was sealed in a 16 mL Teflon lined autoclave and heated at 120 °C for 5 days. The autoclave was then cooled to room temperature at a rate of 2 °C/h. The green crystalline product obtained was separated by filtration and washed with DMF. Yield: 35% (based on tipb). FT-IR (KBr pellets, cm–1): 3127, 1662, 1522, 1399, 1307, 1252, 1095, 1062, 826, 773, 660.
