A mixture of EuCl3∙ 6H2O (109 mg, 0.3 mmol) and bpdc (24 mg, 0.1 mmol) in DMF (10 mL) and DMSO (2 mL) mixed solution was sealed in a Parr pressure bomb and heated at 90 °C for two days. After naturally cooling to room temperature, the yellow crystals were filtered, washed with DMF and dried in air. Yield: 54% based on the metal, elemental analysis: found (wt.%) C 41.15, H 2.79, N 9.41; S, 1.39; calcd (wt.%) C, 41.10; H, 2.64; N, 9.34; S, 1.42. IR spectrum (KBr, cm− 1): 3061, 2929, 2875, 1658, 1589, 1531, 1407.
