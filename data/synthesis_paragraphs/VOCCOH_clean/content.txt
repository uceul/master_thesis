Preparation of {[Ni(H2O)6][Ni4L2(μ3-OH)2(H2O)2]}n (1). A mixture of H4L (0.1 mmol, 33.0 mg), Ni(OAc)2 · 4H2O (0.2 mmol, 48.0 mg), NaOH (0.1 mmol, 4.0 mg) and H2O (15 mL) was placed in a Teflon-lined stainless steel vessel, heated to 160 °C for 3 days, and then cooled to room temperature over 24 h. Green block single crystals of 1 were obtained in 49% yield (25.37 mg, based on Ni). Elemental analysis (%) for C32H28Ni5O26: calcd, C 34.25, H 2.52; found, C 34.29, H 2.47. IR (cm − 1): 3205 m, 1594 m, 1531 s, 1428 m, 1367 s, 1271 m, 831 m, 773 s, 728 s.
