 A mixture of Cu(NO3)2·4H2O (0.024 g, 0.1 mmol) and H8L (0.0158 g, 0.02 mmol) in 4 mL of H2O, 2 mL of EtOH and three drops of HNO3 (2 mol L−1) was sealed in an autoclave equipped with a Teflon linear (25 mL), heated at 100 °C for 3 days, and then cooled to room temperature. Blue block single crystals of 1 were collected in a ca. 62% yield based on H8L. Elemental analysis for C37H90Cu4O55, calcd (%): C, 26.65; H, 5.44. Found (%): C, 26.74; H, 5.45.
