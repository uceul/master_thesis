 The organic linker 5-methoxyl-1,3-bis(3,5-dicarboxylphenyl)-benzene (H4MBDPB) (Scheme 1) was readily synthesized according to ref. 6. 1H NMR (500 MHz, DMSO-d6): 13.31 (bs, 4H), 8.40 (s, 2H), 8.36 (s, 4H), 7.49 (s, 1H), 7.22 (s, 2H), 3.86 (s, 3H). Selected FTIR (neat, cm−1): 3442, 3187, 3085, 2625, 2533, 1701, 1592, 1439, 1389, 1349, 1210, 1139, 1095, 1051, 917, 853, 756, 675. A mixture of H4MBDPB (5.23 mg, 0.012 mmol) and CuCl2·2H2O (13.6 mg, 0.08 mmol) was dissolved in DMF/H2O (2 mL, 5:1, v/v) in a screw-capped vial. A concentrated HNO3 (0.05 mL) (65%, aq.) was added to the mixture, the vial was capped and placed in an oven at 65 °C for 2 days. The resulting blue pyramid-shaped crystals were filtered and washed with DMF several times to give NJFU-3 materials. Yield: 72%. Elemental analysis: calcd for activated Cu2(MBDPB), %: C, 49.34; H, 2.15; N, 0; found: C, 49.16; H, 2.07; N, 0.02. Selected FTIR (neat, cm−1): 3443, 3071, 2932, 2866, 1671, 1635, 1587, 1498, 1436, 1410, 1368, 1304, 1255, 1216, 1154, 1093, 1052, 935, 864, 807, 776, 731, 661.
