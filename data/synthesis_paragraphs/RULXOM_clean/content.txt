A mixture of the H3TATB ligand (0.01 g, 2.26 × 10−5 mol) and FeCl2 (0.02 g, 1.58 × 10−4 mol) together with six drops of DMF and three drops of HBF4 (50% aqua solution) in 1.2 mL of DMSO was first put into a Pyrex glass tube (i.d. 8 mm/o.d. 10 mm) in a glovebox under a nitrogen atmosphere and then sealed by freezing the tube with liquid nitrogen. The sealed tube was heated to 135 °C at a rate of 1 °C/min. After staying at 135 °C for 72 h, it was cooled to 35 °C at a rate of 0.1 °C/min. The resulting dark red crystals were washed with DMSO twice in the glovebox to give pure PCN-9 (Fe) (Fe4O(TATB)8/3·5H2O·10DMSO, yield: 50%). The reaction was amplified to gram quantity using multiple tubes. Elem anal. calcd for PCN-9 (Fe): C, 44.25%; H, 4.51%; N, 4.91%. Found: C, 42.01%; H, 4.45%; N, 4.84%.
