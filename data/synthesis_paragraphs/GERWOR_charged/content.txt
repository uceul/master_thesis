A mixture of Cd(NO3)2·4H2O (0.031 g, 0.1 mmol) and H8L (0.0138 g, 0.02 mmol) in 5 mL of DMF and three drops of HCl (6 mol/L) was sealed in an autoclave equipped with a Teflon linear (25 mL), heated at 120 °C for 3 days, and then cooled to room temperature. Colorless rod single crystals of 3 were collected in a ca. 29% yield based on H8L. Elemental analysis for C88H132Si2Cd3N10O50, calcd (%):C, 41.88; H, 5.27; N, 5.55.
