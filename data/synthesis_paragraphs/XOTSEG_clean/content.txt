MnCl2·4H2O (3.0 mg, 0.015 mmol) and H3LMe (1.1 mg, 0.0020 mmol) were dissolved in DMF (1.0 mL) and then sealed and heated to 90 °C for 48 h. The reaction was cooled to room temperature in 800 min. Light yellow flaky crystals of 1 were obtained and dried at system temperature (yield: 50%, based on manganese). Elemental analysis calcd (%) for 1: C89.5H91.5O23N5.5Mn3: C, 60.49; H, 5.19; N, 4.37. Found: C, 60.13; H, 5.07; N, 4.45. IR data (KBr cm–1): 3430(w), 2926(w), 1655(s), 1602(m), 1538(s), 1389(m), 1098(w), 863(w), 783(w), 700(s), 576(w), 419(w).
