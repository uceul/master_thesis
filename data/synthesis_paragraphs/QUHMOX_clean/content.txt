Complex 3 was obtained by the following hydrothermal method: A mixture of Gd2(SO4)3·8H2O (4 mmol), HCOOH (4 mL), and DMSO (4 mL) was sealed in a Teflon-lined autoclave and heated to 140 °C over 6 h. After the reaction vessel was maintained for 48 h, it was cooled to room temperature over 18 h. Colorless cone-shaped crystals of 3 were harvested with ca. 35% yield based on Gd. FT-IR (KBr pellet, cm–1): 3366, 1565, 1379, 1347, 1151, 1035, 806, 602.
