Method 1: A mixture of Sm(NO3)3·6H2O (8.89 mg, 0.02 mmol), H3pdc (15.61 mg, 0.1 mmol) and CuCO3·Cu(OH)2 (6.63 mg, 0.03 mmol) in water (10 mL) was stirred for 30 min in air, then sealed in a 25 mL Telfon-lined stainless steel container, which was heated to 160 °C for 72 h. After cooling to room temperature at a rate of 2 °C/h, colorless block crystals were obtained, 15% (2.42 mg) yield based on Sm. Anal. Calcd. for C12H16N4O18Sm2 (804.99): C 17.90, H 2.00, N 6.96%. Found: C 17.88, H 2.02, N 6.95%. IR (cm−1): 3403 (m), 1671 (m), 1575 (s), 1515 (m), 1471 (m), 1436 (m), 1098 (m), 585 (m), 528 (m), 507 (m).
