 An aqueous mixture (10.0 mL) containing H2pdc (0.2500 mmol, 41.75 mg), H3[PMo12O40]·nH2O (182.5 mg), LaCl3 (0.2500 mmol, 61.30 mg) and NaF (52.00 mg 0.1250 mmol), with a starting pH of 2.0 adjusted with 1.0 mol L−1 HNO3, was sealed in a 23.0 mL Parr Teflon-lined stainless steel auto-clave, heated to 375 K in an oven for 2 d, and finally cooled naturally to room temperature. Yellow block crystals were obtained in 60% yield (based on Mo). Anal. calcd (%) for C28H44FLa4Mo12N4O72P (Mr = 3345.56): C, 10.0; H, 1.32; N, 1.67; Mo, 34.4%. Found (%): C, 9.95; H, 1.40; N, 1.75; Mo, 33.2%.
