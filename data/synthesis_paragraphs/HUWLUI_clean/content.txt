 Th(NO3)4·6H2O (58.8 mg, 0.1 mmol), H3TPO (43.9 mg, 0.1 mmol), DMF (5 mL), and 3 drops of concentrated nitric acid were placed in a 23 mL PTFE-lined autoclave and heated at 160 °C for 3 days before it was allowed to cool to 25 °C in 2 days. Colorless block crystals appeared in an extremely low yield (ca. <5%). Attempts aiming at improving the yield by changing the reaction parameters such as temperature, time, and concentration were not successful. In addition, some unidentified amorphous solids are always present, making the actual yield determination impossible. Therefore, conventional characterization such as PXRD, IR, and EA are not accomplishable.
