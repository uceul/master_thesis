Synthesis of [H2L][CuL][SiW12O40]⋅2 H2O (1): A mixture of H4[SiW12O40]⋅26 H2O (0.335 g, ca. 0.1 mmol), CuCl2⋅2 H2O (0.034 g, 0.2 mmol), and bimb (0.042 g, 0.2 mmol) was dissolved in 10 mL distilled water and stirred at room temperature for 1 h. The pH value of the above mixture was adjusted to approximately 2.0 with 1.0 m HCl, and then the suspension was transferred into a Teflon‐lined autoclave and kept under autogenous pressure at 160 °C for three days. After the autoclave was slowly cooled to room temperature, yellow crystals of 1 were obtained by filtration and then washed with distilled water (65 % yield based on W). Anal. Calcd for C24H26SiCuN8O42W12: C 8.49, H 0.77, N 3.30. Found: C 8.52, H 0.72, N 3.32. IR (KBr pellet):  =3496(w), 3118(w), 1529(m), 1315(w), 1076(w), 970(m), 920(s), 791 cm−1(s).
