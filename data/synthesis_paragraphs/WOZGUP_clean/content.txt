[Co(BBPTZ)3][HPMo12O40]⋅24 H2O (1): H3PMo12O40⋅24 H2O (0.6 g, ca. 0.3 mmol), Co(OAc)2⋅4 H2O (0.087 g, 0.35 mmol), and BBPTZ (0.16 g, 0.5 mmol) were mixed in distilled water (10 mL) and stirred at room temperature for 0.5 h. During this period, the reaction mixture was adjusted to pH 2.0 with 1.0 M NaOH. Then, the suspension was sealed into a Teflon‐lined autoclave, kept under autogenous pressure at 130 °C for 3 days, and then slowly cooled to room temperature. Orange block crystals of 1 were isolated, collected by filtration, washed with distilled water, and kept in a vacuum desiccator (50 % yield based on Mo). Selected IR (KBr pellet): =3446(w), 3113(m), 3030(w), 1612(m), 1522(s), 1438(m), 1403(w), 1346 (w), 1281 (s), 1210 (m), 1132 (s), 1057 (s), 1010 (w), 956 (s), 879 (w), 802 cm−1 (s); elemental analysis calcd (%) for C54H97N18O64PMo12Co: C 19.85, H 2.97, N 7.72; found: C 19.88, H 2.95, N 7.70. TG curve suggests that compound 1 contains approximately 24 lattice water molecules (see the Supporting Information, Figure S6).
