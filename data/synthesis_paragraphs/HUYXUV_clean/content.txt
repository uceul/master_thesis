Single crystals of 2 suitable for X-ray analysis were obtained by a modified method of that described above for 1. A mixture of Co(NO3)2·6H2O (0.12 mmol, 35 mg) and L (0.1 mmol, 29 mg) was suspended in 10 mL of component solvent (DMF/H2O/C2H5OH = 4/3/3). After addition of 1.0 mL formic acid solution (88%), the suspension was heated in a Teflon-lined autoclave (20 mL) at 140 °C for 4 days. After the mixture was slowly cooled to room temperature, along with a small amount of powder, orange block crystals were obtained. The powder product was removed by decanting with water, and the crystals were rinsed three times with ethanol (8 mL × 3) and dried in air for 2 h (yield ca. 35% based on L). Anal. Calcd for C40H36Co2N8O10: C, 48.79; H, 3.95; N, 12.36. Found: C, 48.42; H, 3.85; N, 12.21%. IR (KBr, cm−1): 3133 (m), 2868 (w), 1590 (s), 1518 (s), 1346 (w), 1313 (w), 1254 (m), 1121 (m), 1063 (s), 961 (m), 939 (w), 815 (w), 739 (m), 653 (m), 518 (m).
