[Mg2(dhtp)(H2O)2]·8H2O (CPO‐27‐Mg): 2,5‐Dihydroxyterephthalic acid (0.149 g, 0.75 × 10–3 mol) was dissolved in THF (10 mL) in the Teflon inlet of an autoclave. An aqueous sodium hydroxide solution (3 mL, 1 mol L–1) was added to this solution while stirring. Magnesium nitrate hexahydrate (0.384 g, 1.5 × 10–3 mol) was dissolved in water (3 mL) and added to the Teflon inlet, upon which a yellow precipitate formed. The autoclave was sealed (filling level ca. 50 %) and the mixture allowed to react at 110 °C for 3 d. Filtration yielded a light yellow substance of small, needle‐shaped crystals (yield 0.200 g, 63 % based on Mg). C4H11MgO8 (211.43): calcd. C 22.72, H 5.24, Mg 11.50, O 60.54; found C 23.43, H 4.87, Mg 12.63, O 49.80. We ascribe the low value found for the O content to the formation of magnesium oxide from which the oxygen was not liberated for detection.
