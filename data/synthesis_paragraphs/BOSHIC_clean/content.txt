 The organic linker H4L (Scheme 1) was readily synthesized according to ref. 5c. 1H NMR (500 MHz, DMSO-D6): δ = 8.60 (2, 2H), 8.27 (d, 4H), 7.84 (d, 2H), 7.65 (d, 2H), 7.62 (d, 2H). A mixture of H4L (15 mg, 0.033 mmol) and CuNO3·2.5H2O (30.00 mg, 0.0645 mmol) was dissolved in DMF/MeCN/H2O (10 mL, 3:1:1, v/v/v) in a screw-capped vial. After HCl (100 μL) (37%, aq.) was added to the mixture, the vial was capped and placed in an oven at 80 °C for 2 days. The resulting blue rhombic shaped crystals were washed with DMF several times to give ZJU-7 materials. Yield: 65%. Elemental analysis: calcd for Cu2(C26H12O8)(H2O)2](DMF)2(MeCN)3(H2O)4(C38H47Cu2N5O14, %): C, 47.70; H, 4.96; N, 7.32; found: C, 47.16; H, 5.07; N, 7.51. Selected FTIR (neat, cm−1): 1650, 1626, 1585, 1492, 1378, 1244, 1170, 1090, 850, 769, 756, 729, 662.
