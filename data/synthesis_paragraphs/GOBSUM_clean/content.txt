Co(NO3)2·6H2O (0.375 g, 1.29 mmol) and H2bdc (0.214 g, 1.29 mmol) were dissolved in 10.0 mL of DMF. After adding dabco (0.048 g, 0.43 mmol) and CH3CN (5 mL), the mixture was stirred for 2 h at room temperature. The greenish-blue precipitate was filtered off after centrifuge, and the purple filtrate was put into a glass tube. The tube was flame-sealed and heated to 100 °C for 36 h. Purple crystals of diamond shape were collected, washed with DMF/CH3CN mixture (1:1 v/v), and dried under vacuum. The yield was 0.322 g or 76% based on [Co3(bdc)3(dabco)(dmf)2](CH3CN)(H2O). EA Calcd: C, 46.26; H, 4.39; N, 7.10. Found: C, 46.18; H, 4.12; N, 7.61%. The as-synthesized crystals were soaked in CH3CN for 2 days, and evacuated by dynamic vacuum at room temperature for 12 h to give the dehydrated form [Co3(bdc)3(dabco)]·0.5(H2O). EA Calcd: C, 45.59; H, 3.19; N, 3.54. Found: C, 45.39; H, 3.04; N, 3.57%.
