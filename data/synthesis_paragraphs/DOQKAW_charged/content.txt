‡ Synthesis: A DMA solution (5 mL) containing Cd(NO3)2·4H2O (92 mg, 0.3 mmol), H2bdc (41 mg, 0.25 mmol), Htrz (17 mg, 0.25 mmol), and Hbtrz (30 mg, 0.25 mmol) in a Teflon-lined steel bomb was heated at 140 °C for 2 days. Colorless block-shaped crystals were collected, washed with Et2O, and dried at room temperature (yield: 61 mg, 60% based on Cd). Elemental analysis (%) calcd for 1: C 37.11, H 2.64, N 11.65; found: C 37.33, H 2.75, N 11.52%.
