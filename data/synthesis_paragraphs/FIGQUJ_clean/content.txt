Cu(NO3)2·2.5H2O (43 mg, 0.185 mmol), glutaric acid (49 mg, 0.185 mmol) and 3-pna (37 mg, 0.185 mmol) were placed into 5 mL distilled H2O in a 15 mL screw-cap vial. The vial was sealed and heated in an oil bath at 90 °C for 24 h, and then cooled slowly to 25 °C. Blue blocks of 3 (31 mg, 39% yield based on Cu) were isolated after washing with distilled water and acetone, and drying in air. Anal.
