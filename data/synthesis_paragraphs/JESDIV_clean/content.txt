The compound 1 was synthesized hydrothermally by a typical solution mediated reaction: 0.05 g Ga2O3, 0.80 ml H3PO3, 0.50 g piperazine, 0.60 ml HF and 2 ml of water was stirred for 30 min at room temperature, then the mixture was transferred to a 23 ml PTFE-lined stainless-steel hydrothermal autoclave at a filling capacity of ∼9% and heated at 180 °C for 3 d under autogenous pressure. The initial and final pH of reaction mixture was ∼1. Fine rod-shaped crystals, were filtered off, washed with water and dried at room temperature (yield=60% based on Ga).
