Synthesis of 1: A mixture of Cu(NO3)2·3H2O (481 mg; 2 mmol), 3‐aminopyrazine‐2‐carboxylicacid (139 mg; 1 mmol), and H2O (9 mL) was sealed in a 15 mL Teflon‐lined reactor, which was heated in an oven to 120 °C for 72 h, then cooled to room temperature at a rate of 3 °C·h–1 to obtain green plate crystals. Elemental analysis for C20H16Cu5N10O22): calcd. C 22.53; H 1.51; N 13.14 %; found: C, 22.59; H, 1.48; N, 13.10 %. The crystals were dried at 40 °C at reduced pressure for 10 h before the elemental analysis and a crystal taken for X‐ray investigations before drying proved to contain ten molecule of H2O per formula unit.
