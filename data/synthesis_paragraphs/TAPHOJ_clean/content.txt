  Zinc nitrate hexahydrate (55 mg, 0.185 mmol), bpmp (50 mg, 0.186 mmol), sodium 5-sulfoisophthalate (50 mg, 0.186 mmol), and 5 mL H2O were placed into a 15 mL glass vial, followed by 1 mL of 1.0 M NaOH solution. The vial was placed in an oil bath at 90 °C for 48 h, whereupon it was cooled slowly to 25 °C. Colorless blocks of 6 (56 mg, 46% yield based on Zn) were isolated after washing with distilled water and acetone, and drying in air. Anal. Calc. for C24H32N4O11SZn 6: C, 44.35; H, 4.96; N, 8.62%. Found: C, 43.89; H, 4.46; N, 8.57%.
