Pale pink crystals of MOF-123 were isolated by filtration, washed with additional acetonitrile, and dried under vacuum. The crystalline product was obtained in a yield of 75%, confirmed to be phase-pure by powder X-ray diffraction analysis.

In a 50 mL Schlenk flask, 0.500 g (1.0 mmol) of cobalt nitrate hexahydrate and 0.200 g (1.5 mmol) of terephthalic acid were dissolved in 20 mL of acetonitrile to form a homogeneous solution. Subsequently, 0.050 mL (0.3 mmol) of HBF4 was added dropwise with continuous stirring to stabilize the intermediate species and enhance crystallinity. The mixture was then transferred to a Teflon-lined autoclave, sealed, and heated to 434.2 K for 37.09 hours under autogenous pressure. Upon completion, the autoclave was allowed to cool down to room temperature naturally. Pale pink crystals of MOF-123 were isolated by filtration, washed with additional acetonitrile, and dried under vacuum. The crystalline product was obtained in a yield of 75%, confirmed to be phase-pure by powder X-ray diffraction analysis. Elemental analysis of the product indicated satisfactory agreement with the calculated values, confirming the stoichiometry and integrity of the framework.

The reaction mixture was transferred to a Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave (20 mL capacity), which was then heated at 210.372 °C for 58.49 minutes. Upon gradual cooling to ambient temperature, colorless block crystals of MOF-1 were collected through filtration, yielding approximately 60% based on the zinc ions.

A new metal-organic framework (MOF) was synthesized from a mixture of zinc nitrate hexahydrate (Zn(NO3)2·6H2O), terephthalic acid, and 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (DABCO) in the presence of dimethylformamide (DMF) as a solvent. Approximately 0.5 g of Zn(NO3)2·6H2O and 0.25 g of terephthalic acid were dissolved in 15 mL DMF, followed by the addition of 0.1 g DABCO and a catalytic amount of hexafluoropropene. The mixture was stirred vigorously at room temperature until a homogeneous solution was achieved. Subsequently, the solution was transferred to a 50 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave, which was filled to 60% of its total volume capacity. The vessel was then sealed and heated to 125 °C for 128.74 minutes under autogenous pressure. After the heating period, the autoclave was allowed to cool to room temperature. Colorless, needle-shaped crystals of the MOF were collected via filtration, washed with DMF, and dried under vacuum. The yield of the product was approximately 45% based on the initial zinc content.

The solution was stirred vigorously at room temperature for 15 minutes to ensure complete dissolution of the reactants. The mixture was transferred to a 50 mL Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave and heated in an oven at 168.01 °C for 191 minutes. Upon completion of the reaction time, the autoclave was allowed to cool to room temperature naturally. The resultant blue crystalline product was subjected to repeated washing with fresh methanol (25 mL) for three cycles to remove any unreacted ligands or metal salts. The isolated product was dried under vacuum at 100 °C for 6 hours, resulting in pure copper-based MOF labeled Cu-BDC-MeIm, with a yield of 0.358 g corresponding to a 78% yield based on copper nitrate trihydrate starting material.
