The final mixture was placed in a 20 mL glass vial, which was sealed and heated at 75 °C for 24 h, and then cooled to room temperature. Rhombus-shaped turquoise crystals of 1 were collected in 42% yield (based on ligand m-H4TCPB). Anal. calcd for C49H55O13N3Cu2: C, 57.64; H, 5.43; and N, 4.12. Found: C, 57.70; H, 5.46; and N, 4.17.

It was formulated on the bases of single-crystal X-ray structure determination, elemental analysis, and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). A single-crystal X-ray crystallographic study revealed that 1 crystallizes in the monoclinic system and C2/c space group [18]. As quite frequently observed in MOFs, the framework contains paddle-wheel binuclear {Cu2(COO)4} secondary building units (Fig. 1a), which are bridged by organic m-TCPB ligands to form a two-dimensional (2D) hexagonal grid {Cu2(m-TCPB)2} (Fig. 1b). The adjacent 2D hexagonal grid is packed in parallel, leading to the final porous-containing three-dimensional (3D) frameworks with the cavities of 8.5 × 12.6 Å2 (Fig. 1d). The structure of 1 is non-interpenetrated and the topology (Fig. S2) can be best described as a simple 4, 4 connected net (Fig. 1c, d), which exhibits the same topology as well-established MOFs, such as: MOF-2 Zn(BDC)-(DMF), Cu(BDC-OH), Zn2(TBAPy), and UTSA-72 [19], [20], [21], [22]. The fifth coordination sites of paddle–wheel Cu2(COO)4 units were occupied by water molecules, which will be critical for the gas-absorption selectivity. Upon water molecules removal, the open sites will be exposed for other applications. The solvent accessible volume after the removal of the uncoordinated solvents is 59.6% calculated with PLATON [23].";75;24;[12051, 962];[['diethylformamide', 'def'], ['water', 'h2o']];[313];[['hcl']];['2 entries found for solvent CID 12051', '2 entries found for solvent CID 962']

The analytical grade starting chemicals were obtained from Aldrich and used as received. 3.60 g [CN3H6]2CO3, 0.41 g ZnO and 25 ml deionized water were combined in a 30 ml plastic bottle, shaken well, and placed in a 90 °C oven for 42 h. Solid product recovery from the pH 12 mother liquors resulted in 0.58 g (38% yield based on Zn) of large (to 3 mm), translucent octahedral chunks of [CN3H6]2[Zn(CO3)2]. The crystal quality of this initial batch was too poor for single crystal structure determination. Much better crystals were obtained from the following reaction: 0.31 g (5 mmol) H3BO3 and 3.60 g (20 mmol) [CN3H6]2CO3 were dissolved in 18.0 g deionized water at 90 °C in a HDPE bottle. 0.81 g (10 mmol) ZnO was added and the suspension shaken thoroughly. The bottle was placed in an oven and held at 90 °C for 68 h. The solid product, consisting of a majority of gem-like, faceted, transparent crystals (maximum dimension ≈0.2 mm) of [CN3H6]2[Zn(CO3)2] and a minority component of white powder, was recovered by filtration, washing with water, then with methanol, and dried at 90 °C. The yield was 26%, based on Zn. The boric acid is not incorporated in the crystalline product, but it may affect the nucleation rate of [CN3H6]2[Zn(CO3)2] crystals from solution, thus improving their quality.

This mixture was heated up to 100 °C for 18 hours to yield reddish needle-shaped crystals. After decanting the mother liquor and washing with DMF, the solid product was immersed in methanol, an exchanging solvent with a low boiling point, for 24 hours, renewing it once by a new fresh solvent during this period of time. Finally, the samples were dried at 70 °C under vacuum (0.2 bar). These materials were denoted as Cux-S, where x is the metal–linker molar ratio and S indicates the co-solvent used: W or P for water and 2-propanol, respectively. Samples were finally activated removing the methanol under vacuum and heating prior to N2 and CO2 adsorption–desorption isotherms.

To this, H2O (0.15 mL) was added and the mixture stirred until complete dissolution of all reagents had occurred. The reactants were heated in a sealed 20 mL Teflon‐lined autoclave at 100 °C for 20 hours. The resulting white crystalline solid was isolated by suction filtration. In situ crystallisation studies were carried out on Beamline I12 (JEEP) of the Diamond Light Source.16 A specially constructed reaction cell made from polyether ether ketone (PEEK) was used to investigate solvothermal crystallisation: a 5 mL internal volume tube of 12 mm internal diameter that was fitted with a screw‐top lid that allowed moderate pressure to be contained and reactions up to 150 °C to be investigated. An internal thermocouple, threaded through the lid of the reaction tube allowed continuous monitoring of temperature during reactions. The reaction was stirred rapidly with a smaller Teflon‐coated magnetic follower to aid heat transfer and to ensure that uniform solid product was present in the X‐ray beam throughout the experiment. The tube was heated within the ODISC infra‐red furnace,17 with a glassy carbon sheath around the sample to allow heat transfer to the reaction vessel. A wavelength of 0.2242 Å was used and 2D diffraction patterns collected every minute using a Pixium image plate detector (430×430 mm2) with an exposure time of 4000 ms. The system was calibrated with a crystalline CeO2 reference and the 2D image plate data were integrated using the fit2d software to give 1D diffraction patterns.18 The time‐resolved in situ data sets were analysed using sequential Pawley decompositions and Rietveld refinements, as implemented in TOPAS.19 CCDC 1057461 contain the supplementary crystallographic data for this paper.

Data were collected on a Siemens SMART diffractometer using Mo Kα radiation (λ=0.71073 Å). An empirical absorption correction based on redundant reflections was applied to the data set. The absolute configuration was unambiguously assigned based on the analysis of the Bijovot pairs and the refinement of the Flack parameter. The absence of inversion center in the structure was also confirmed by MISYM. The refinement of Flack parameter for the chosen configuration gave 0.00020(9) with 5239 reflections where Fc(H) and Fc(–H) differ by more than 0.0001. The asymmetric unit contains two Cd2+ ions, two 4,4′-bipy ligands, two SO4 2− anions, and three coordinate and three crystallization water molecules. The metal centers are first linked by the SO4 2− anions to form the one-dimensional arrays of fused 12-membered rings containing three cadmium, three sulfur and six oxygen atoms (see Fig. 1). The arrays are drawn together by hydrogen bonding between the coordinate water molecules and the SO4 2− anions from the adjacent net. The two SO4 2− anions are split into μ2- and μ3-bridging ligands. Thus, Cd(1) is coordinated by a μ2-SO4 2−, a μ3-SO4 2− and two cis-H2O molecules while the Cd(2) is linked by a μ2-SO4 2−, two different μ3-SO4 2− anions and a water. The 4,4′-bipy ligands act as ‘posts’ that connect the cadmium centers to form the one-dimensional [Cd2(4,4′-bipy)2(H2O)3]n 4+ chains. The coordination of both Cd atoms can best be described as slightly distorted octahedral with four O atoms situated in the square plane and two N atoms occupying the axial positions. Fig. 2 depicts the coordination environments of the two Cd atoms. Rather than being parallel, these chains run across each other from two different directions. Thus, the compound forms three-dimensional interwoven networks as shown in Fig. 3. The most common coordination modes of the SO4 2− ion are monodentate, bidentate and μ2-bridging, while μ3-bridging is much less frequent [11]. The combination of both μ2- and μ3-bridging in the same structure is hitherto unreported. The fact that 1 crystallizes in a noncentrosymmetric space group can perhaps be attributed to this unusual combination of the two different bridging modes for the SO4 2− anion. We have noticed that the use of simple, weaker coordinating anions such as NO3 − and ClO4 − results in centrosymmetric more often than noncentrosymmetric crystal packing.;120;24;[962];[['water', 'oxygen atom', 'h2o']];[];[];['3 entries found for solvent CID 962']

The density was measured by the flotation method in a mixture of bromoform/chloroform, being 1.67(2) g cm−3. The IR spectrum shows the bands corresponding to the vibrational modes of the bpy organic molecule and (VO4)3− vanadate anions, which appear in the 1600–990 and 930–530 cm−1, ranges, respectively. The characteristic bands of the bpy molecule δ(ring), δ(CN) and δ(CC) appear at 990, 1530, 1605 cm−1, respectively. The broad band near at 3430 cm−1 confirms the existence of crystallization water molecules into the crystal structure (ESI, Fig. S1). The studied compound was characterized by X-ray powder diffraction data. The patterns were recorded in a BRUKER D8 ADVANCE Vario Diffractometer (Cu Kα = 1.54053 Å), between 5° and 70° in 2θ, counting 5 s per step (0.015°). The Rietveld analysis of the powder patterns indicates the absence of impurities in the different samples (ESI, Fig. S2).
