BaCl2·2H2O (0.020 g, 0.12 mmol), H4L (0.013 g, 0.03 mmol), FeCl3·6H2O (0.009 g, 0.03 mmol), NaCl (0.004 g, 0.06 mmol), N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) (1 mL), EtOH (4 mL), and water (2 mL) were mixed to obtain a brown suspension. The mixture was placed in a Teflon reactor, heated at 100 °C for 3 days, and then slowly cooled to room temperature. The brown crystals were filtered, washed with H2O, and dried in air (yield: 31%).
