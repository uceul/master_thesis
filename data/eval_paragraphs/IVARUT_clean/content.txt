CdCl2·6H2O (52 mg, 0.18 mmol), bpmp (99 mg, 0.37 mmol), 1,4-phenylenedipropionic acid (44 mg, 0.18 mmol), and 5 mL deionized water were placed into a 15 mL screw-cap vial. The vial was sealed and heated in an oil bath at 80 °C for 72 h, and then cooled slowly to 25 °C. Colorless blocks of 2 (45 mg, 36% yield based on Cd) were isolated after washing with distilled water, ethanol, and acetone and drying in air. Anal.
