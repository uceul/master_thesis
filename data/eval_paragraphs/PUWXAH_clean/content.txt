 A mixture of H3btc (0.84 g, 4 mmol) and NaOH (0.48 g, 12 mmol) in 10 ml distilled water was stirred for 1 h, followed by addition of a solution of MnCl2·H20 (0.25 g, 1.26 mmol) in 5 ml H2O. The resulting solution was stirred for about 1 h at room temperature, then sealed in a 23 ml, teflon-lined, stainless steel autoclave and heated at 220 °C for three days under autogenous pressure. The reaction mixture was then cooled to room temperature over a period of 4 h. Pink crystals of 1 suitable for single crystal X-ray diffraction analysis were collected from the final reaction mixture by filtration and dried in air at ambient temperature (52.8% yield based on manganese), Anal. calcd. C27H21Mn3NaO23: C 35.98%, Mn 18.28%. Found, C 37.15%, Mn 19.36%. FT-IR (KBr, cm−1): 3409 brs, 2997 w, 1720 s, 1622 s, 1559 s, 1447 s, 1378 s, 1266 m, 1193 s, 1103 s, 1023 w, 938 w, 755 s, 715 s, 525 s, 461 s. The broad band at 3409 cm−1 is characteristic of the υOH of a protonated carboxylic group of Hbtc. The TGA data of 1 showed an initial weight loss between 85 and 200 °C corresponding to the loss of coordinated water molecules, (exp% = 10, calc% = 9.9). The second weight loss at 350 °C is attributed to the loss of all btc ligands to yield Mn3O4 as residue.
