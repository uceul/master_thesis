A mixture of Cd(NO3)2⋅4H2O (0.062 g, 0.20 mmol), H2PAM (0.039 g, 0.10 mmol), dpe (0.036 g, 0.20 mmol), H2O (10 mL), and DMF (2 mL) was sealed in a 25 mL Teflon‐lined stainless steel autoclave and heated at 120 °C for 72 h. After cooling to RT, yellow crystals were obtained in a yield of 49 % based on Cd. IR (KBr): =3387 (w), 1643 (m), 1608 (m), 1558 (vs), 1499 (w), 1452 (m), 1390 (m), 1354 (m), 1201 (w), 1011 (w), 822 (s), 751 (w), 543 (w) cm−1; elemental analysis calcd (%) for C76H57N5O14Cd2 (1489.09): C 61.30, H 3.86, N 4.70; found: C 61.54, H 3.90, N 4.62.
