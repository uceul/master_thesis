A mixture of H4TSTC (0.0357 g, 0.1 mmol), CrCl2 (0.0123 g, 0.1 mmol), Cu(NO3)2·3H2O (0.0241 g, 0.1 mmol), NaOH (0.0160 g, 0.1 mmol), water (5 mL) and DMF (10 mL) was sealed in a 25 mL stainless steel reactor with a Teflon-liner and kept heating at 160 °C for 3 days, then cooled to room temperature at a rate of 10 °C/h. The crystalline products were collected upon being washed with DMF and H2O. The crystals of compound 1 were obtained in 38% yield based on Cu(II). ICP analysis of compound 1 gave the contents of Cu and Cr as 11.02 and 2.97 wt.%, respectively, indicating a Cu/Cr ratio of about 3:1. SEM and optional images of the crystalline samples are shown in Fig. S1.
