A mixture of Tb(ClO4)3·6H2O (28.5 mg, 0.05 mmol), H2BPDC (24.4 mg, 0.1 mmol), CoCl2·6H2O (11.9 mg, 0.05 mmol), H2O (1 mL), and DMA (4 mL) were added to a 8 mL glass vial. The glass vessel was heated at 80 °C for 3 days under autogenous pressure and then cooled to room temperature at 2 °C/h under ambient conditions. The colorless block crystals were obtained and washed with DMA. Yield: 50%, based on Tb(ClO4)3·6H2O. Elemental analysis (%) Calcd for compound 2 (TbCoC26H40.5N4.5O20.5Cl): C 31.31, H 4.06, N 6.32. Found: C 31.36, H 4.10, N 6.34.
