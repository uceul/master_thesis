Tb(NO3)3·5H2O (100 mg, 0.23 mmol) dissolved in DMF (10 mL) was added to a solution of N-H2BDC (61 mg, 0.34 mmol) in DMF (10 mL) in a glass tube (Duran culture tube, diameter 18 mm, height 180 mm). The tube was sealed; the contents were well mixed and then placed in an oven at 120 °C for 20 h, resulting in the formation of single crystals in high yield (106 mg, 82%). The crystals were filtered, washed with a little DMF (∼5 mL), and then dried in the vacuum oven for 15 min. Anal. found: for [Tb2(N-BDC)3(dmf)4]∞: C, 37.42; H, 4.28; N, 8.99%. Calcd: C, 37.68; H, 3.78; N, 8.54%. Selected IR data (Neat): 3453 (w) ν(OH), 3343 (w) ν(NH), 2936 (w) ν(CH), 1669 (m) ν(CO), 1651 (m) νas(COO), 1544 (m) ν(C═C), 1497 (m) νs(COO), 1419 (m) ν(CO), 1374 (s) ν(CN), 1253 (m) ν(CO), 770 (s) δ(OCO), 676 (s) δ(═CH) cm−1. The crystals were analyzed by single-crystal X-ray diffraction and by X-ray powder diffraction.
