 A mixture of 1H-1,2,4-triazole (13.8 mg, 0.2 mmol), maleic acid (23.2 mg, 0.2 mmol) and Cu(OAc)2·H2O (60 mg, 0.3 mmol) was dissolved in 6 mL deionized water and stirred for 10 min at room temperature. The resulting mixture was sealed in a 25 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave and heated at 120 °C for 3000 min, after which it was cooled over 13 h to room temperature. The blue flower-like crystals were isolated by filtration, washed with water, rinsed with ethanol, and dried in air. The yield was 60% based on copper. Anal. Calc.
