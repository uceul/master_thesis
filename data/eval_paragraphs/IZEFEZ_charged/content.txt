To a 10 mL Pyrex glass tube was loaded Cd(NO3)2·4H2O (8 mg, 0.025 mmol), H4L (13 mg, 0.0125 mmol), 1.5 mL of DMF and 1.5 mL of EtOH, forming a red clear solution. After the pH value was adjusted to 5.0–6.0 by addition of 0.5 M HClO4, the tube was sealed and heated in an oven to 90 °C for one day, and then cooled to ambient temperature at the rate of 5 °C h-1 to form red blocks of 3, which were collected and washed with EtOH and dried in air. Yield: 14 mg (62%, based on Cd). Anal. Calcd. for C278H231Cd7N41O75.5: C, 53.75; H, 4.90; N, 9.24. Found: C, 53.99; H, 4.63; N, 9.65.
