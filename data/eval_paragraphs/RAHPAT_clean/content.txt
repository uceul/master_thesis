Preparation of [Cu3(C36H13NO12)(H2O)3]⋅9 DMF⋅18 H2O (NOTT‐114): H6L (0.1 g, 0.15 mmol) and Cu(NO3)2⋅3 H2O (0.28 g, 1.2 mmol) were mixed and dispersed in DMF/H2O (60 mL, 5:1 v/v). HCl (2 M, 0.3 mL) was added to the mixture and mixed thoroughly. The solution was heated without stirring in an oil bath at 85 °C for 18 h, and a large amount of microcrystalline product precipitated. The blue crystalline product was separated by filtration and washed with warm DMF, and dried briefly in air. Yield: 0.22 g (92 %); elemental analysis calcd (%) for C63H118Cu3N10O42: C 40.29, H 6.33, N 7.46; found: C 40.89, H 5.12, N 7.18; selected IR (KBr): =3443 (s), 3377 (s), 2209 (w), 1661 (vs), 1583 (s), 1495 (w), 1434 (s), 1378 (s), 1304 (w), 1280 (w), 1254 (w), 1153 (w), 1101 (m), 1062 (w), 1012 (w), 966 (w), 919 (w), 888 (w), 866 (w), 848 (w), 776 (m), 735 (m), 693 (w), 664 (m), 605 cm−1 (w).
