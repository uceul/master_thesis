Synthesis of [Cu3(L2)2(H2O)3]⋅5 DMF⋅6.5 H2O (ZJU‐36): H3L2 (20 mg, 0.076 mmol), Cu(NO3)2⋅3H2O (40 mg, 0.17 mmol), 0.1 M HCl (5.4 mL), DMF (20 mL), and H2O (4 mL) were mixed and heated at 65 °C for two days. Blue crystals of ZJU‐36 were collected by filtration, washed with EtOH and Et2O, and dried in air. Yield: 79 %; IR (KBr pellet): =1652 (s), 1588 (m), 1497 (w), 1437 (m), 1397 (s), 1282 (m), 1165 (w), 1101 (m), 984 (m), 870 (m), 789 (m), 754 (w), 665 (w), 611 cm−1 (w); elemental analysis calcd (%) for C41H68N5Cu3O26.5: C 39.53, H 5.50, N 5.62; found: C 39.43, H 5.59, N 5.79.
