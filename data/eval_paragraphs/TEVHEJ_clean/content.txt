A polyhedron-based MOF was prepared from the reaction of BDC (0.160 g, 1 mmol), na (0.120 g, 1 mmol) and Ni(NO3)2·6H2O (0.300 g, 1 mmol) in a DMF (12 mL) solution. This solution was sealed in a Teflon-lined stainless steel digestion bomb (15 mL) and heated to 140 °C, and this temperature was maintained for 48 h. It was then cooled to room temperature at 10 °C min−1 to give green block crystals of 1, which was formulated as (Ni3O)2Ni(H2O)2(BDC)6(na)4 (37% yield, based on Ni). The purity of 1 was confirmed by similarities between simulated and experimental X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD) as shown in Fig. S3.
