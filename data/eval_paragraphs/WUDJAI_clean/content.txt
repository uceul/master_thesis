 A mixture of 2-sulfoterephthalic acid monosodium salt (0.0402 g, 0.15 mmol), Co(NO3)2·6H2O (0.0873 g, 0.30 mmol), 4,4′-bipyridine (0.2191 g, 1.40 mmol) and water (1.5 mL) was placed in a 25 mL stainless reactor with Teflon liner and heated to 160 °C for 48 h. Then, it was cooled down to room temperature at a rate of −6 °C h−1. Orange coloured crystals were separated by filtration, washed with deionised water and dried in air. Yield: 0.051 g (31%).
