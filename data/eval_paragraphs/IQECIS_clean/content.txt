CoSO4⋅7 H2O (0.029 g, 0.103 mmol), tpt (0.019 g, 0.061 mmol), and H3btb (0.021 g, 0.048 mmol) were added in the solvent mixture of N,N‐dimethylacetamide (DMA, 5 mL)/methanol (CH3OH, 5 mL)/1,4‐dioxane (1 mL) solvent in a 20 mL screw‐capped vial, then 100 μL HBF4 (tetrafluoroboric acid, 40 % in water) was added into the solution and the mixture was sonicated for 30 min. Finally, the mixture was sealed and heated to 120 °C for 5 days. The red octahedral crystals of MFOF‐1 (yield based on CoSO4⋅7 H2O, 66 %) were filtered, washed with DMA and CH3OH, and dried in the air. Elemental analysis (%): calcd: (found) For C81H89.5N16.5Co4F3O19.5S MFOF‐1: C, 50.38 (50.69); H, 4.67 (4.60); N, 11.97 (12.11).
