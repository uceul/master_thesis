 In a 20 ml glass vial, the organic linker H4DTPD (10 mg, 0.0194 mmol) was dissolved in 12.85 mL of N,N-dimethyl formamide (DMF). Then, Cu(NO3)2·2.5H2O (20 mg, 0.086 mmol) and 2.15 mL of H2O were added into the vial, followed by 75 μL of HCl (37%, aq.). The glass vial was capped and placed in a precision oven at 80 °C for 3 days. Green rhombic shaped crystals were obtained after cooling to room temperature and washed with DMF three times to afford ZJU-12. Elemental analysis: calcd for [Cu2(C28H16O10)(H2O)2]·(DMF)5·(H2O)2 (C43H59Cu2N5O19, %): C, 48.04; H, 5.36; N, 6.52; found: C, 48.075; H, 5.564; N, 6.707.
