A mixture of Cd(NO3)2·4H2O (3.1 mg, 0.010 mmol), H3LMe (1.1 mg, 0.0020 mmol), 1.0 mL of DMF was placed in a sealed glass tube. The final mixture was sealed in a glass vial and heated at 120 °C for 48 h. Yellow needle crystals of 2 were gained and dried at indoor temperature (yield: 40%, based on cadmium). Elemental analysis calcd (%) for 2: C174H164O38.5N10Cd6: C, 56.7; H, 4.49; N, 3.80. Found: C, 57.03; H, 4.21; N, 3.68.
