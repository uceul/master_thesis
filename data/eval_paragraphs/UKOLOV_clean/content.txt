A mixture DMF/C2H5OH/H2O (1.00/0.25/0.25 mL) containing the acid form of TCA (H3TCA)17 (0.005 g, 1.32×10−5 mol) and Zn(NO3)2⋅6 H2O (0.017 g, 5.71×10−5 mol) was sealed under vacuum in a quartz tube (10 mm external diameter, 15 cm length, 6 mL capacity) and heated (0.5 °C min−1.) to 90 °C for 20 h, then cooled at 0.1 °C min−1 to room temperature. The light brown truncated octahedral crystals were washed with a DMF/ethanol mixture (3–4 mL) to give MOF‐150 (0.01 g 55 % yield). Elemental analysis calcd (%) for C51H51O19N5Zn4=[Zn4O(TCA)2]⋅(DMF)3⋅(H2O)3: C 47.14, H 3.96, N 5.39; found C 47.98, H 3.84, N 5.40.
