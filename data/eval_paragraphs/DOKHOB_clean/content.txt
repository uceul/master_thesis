 A mixture of CuSO4·5H2O (20 mg, 0.08 mmol), H3TMBTC (10 mg, 0.04 mmol) and 4,4′-bpy (10 mg, 0.06 mmol) was suspended in a mixed solution of EtOH (5 ml) and H2O (5 ml), and heated in a Teflon-lined steel bomb at 180 °C for 12 h. The green crystalline precipitate formed was collected, washed with water and dried under air (yield: 35%). Elemental analysis calcd (%) for 2: C 50.07, H 3.82, N 5.31; found: C 52.26, H 3.98, N 4.67%.
