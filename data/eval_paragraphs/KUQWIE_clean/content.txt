A mixture of CdCl2·2.5H2O (0.11 g, 0.5 mmol) and H3L (0.13 g, 0.5 mmol) was dissolved in 10 mL distilled water. The pH value was adjusted to 7.0 by adding ethylenediamine solution dropwise. The resulting solution was stirred for about 1 h at room temperature, sealed in a 20 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave, and then heated at 160 °C for 96 h under autogenous pressure. After the mixture was cooled slowly to room temperature, the colorless plate crystals of compound 1 were obtained. Yield: 35.9% (based on Cd).
