‡ Synthesis of MOF1: H4EBTC (5.0 mg, 0.014 mmol), Cu(NO3)2·3H2O (15 mg, 0.06 mmol), DMF (0.2 mL), DMSO (0.2 mL) and HNO3 (0.060 mL, 1.0 M in DMF) were placed in a 8 mL glass vial, which was sealed and heated to 65 °C for 24 h, and then cooled to room temperature. The cyan block-shaped crystals formed were collected and air-dried (6.3 mg, 55.20% based on H4EBTC). Elemental analysis (%) calcd for [Cu2(EBTC)(H2O)2]·8H2O·DMF·DMSO: C 34.16, H 4.86, N 1.73. Found: C 33.80, H 5.02, N 1.42.
