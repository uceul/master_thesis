Co(NO3)2·6H2O (0.155 g, 0.53 mmol) and H2ndc (0.116 g, 0.54 mmol) were dissolved in 10.0 mL of DMF. After adding dabco (0.020 g, 0.18 mmol) and o-xylene (5 mL), the mixture was stirred for 2 h at room temperature. The greenish-blue precipitate was filtered off after centrifugation, and the purple filtrate was put into a glass vial. The vial was tightly sealed and heated to 110 °C for 36 h. Purple crystals of diamond shape were collected, washed with DMF, and soaked in toluene. The yield was 0.173 g or 66% based on [Co3(ndc)3(dabco)]·6(C7H8). Elemental analysis calcd for [Co3(ndc)3(dabco)]·4(C7H8)·(H2O): C, 63.79; H, 4.89; N, 2.13. Found: C, 63.76; H, 5.02; N, 2.68%. The as-synthesized crystals were guest-exchanged with CH3Cl, and evacuated under dynamic vacuum at room temperature for 12 h to give the dehydrated form [Co3(ndc)3(dabco)]·2(H2O). EA Calcd: C, 52.14; H, 3.54; N, 2.90. Found: C, 52.50; H, 3.31; N, 3.05%.
