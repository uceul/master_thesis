
A mixture of CuBr (29 mg, 0.2 mmol), H2bptp (35 mg, 0.1 mmol), 2 mL of ammonia and 8 mL of MeCN was placed in a Teflon reactor, which was heated at 150 °C for 3 days. Upon cooling to room temperature, yellow block crystals of 2 were collected in 64% yield based on H2bptp. Anal. calcd for C39H26N19O2Cu5: C, 42.18%; H, 2.36%; N, 23.97%. Found: C, 42.22%; H, 2.33%; N, 23.92%. IR (KBr, cm−1): 3411(m), 1638(m), 1615(s), 1568(w), 1400(m), 1062(w), 846(w), 749(w).
