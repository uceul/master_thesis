The title compound was synthesized from a gel containing ethylenediamine (en) as the structure-directing agent. In a typical synthesis, 0.464 g of FeCl3–6H2O and 0.169 g of MnCl2–4H2O was dispersed and dissolved in 3 ml of water. To this, 0.7 ml of phosphoric acid (aq. 85 wt.%) and 0.34 ml of en was added and stirred vigorously. To this solution, 0.2 ml of HF was added and the mixture was stirred until homogeneous. The final mixture, a thick white gel, with a composition, 2FeCl3–6H2O–MnCl2–4H2O–12H3PO4–6en–3HF–200H2O, was transferred onto a 7 ml PTFE-lined acid digestion bomb and heated at 180°C for 64 h. The fill factor was ∼50%. The resultant product contained only colorless rods, suitable for single-crystal X-ray diffraction, and was filtered and washed thoroughly with deionized distilled water. The pH of the mixture did not show any appreciable change during the hydrothermal reaction and remained at 2.0. The initial characterization was carried out using powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The powder XRD pattern indicated that the product is a new material; the pattern is entirely consistent with the structure determined using the single-crystal X-ray diffraction. A least-squares fit of the powder XRD (CuKα) lines, using the hkl indices generated from single-crystal X-ray data, gave the following cell: a=9.333(1), b=8.845(1), c=9.447(1) Å, β=117.6(2)°, which is in excellent agreement with that determined using the single-crystal XRD. Powder data for I, [C2N2H10][Fe2(HPO4)4], are listed in Table 1. EDAX analysis indicated that the final product did not contain any Mn and the Fe–P ratio was 1:2, consistent with the stoichiometry determined using the single-crystal studies.
