A mixture of Zn(NO3)2·6H2O (60 mg, 0.20 mmol), H4L2 (23 mg, 0.05 mmol), 4-abpt (24 mg, 0.10 mmol), H2O (5.0 mL), and DMF (1.0 mL) was sealed in a 15 mL Teflon-lined reactor and heated at 85 °C for 72 h. Colorless crystals of 5 were obtained with 49.0% yield (21.7 mg, 0.025 mmol) based on H4L2. Anal. Calcd for C36H31N6O13.5Zn2: C, 48.33; H, 3.55; N, 9.40. Found: C, 46.08; H, 4.12; N, 9.48. IR (KBr, cm–1): 3450m, 3357w, 3072w, 2929w, 1655m, 1618s, 1556s, 1453m, 1413m, 1361s, 1261m, 1034s, 779s, 735s.
