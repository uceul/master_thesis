UTSA‐20 was synthesized by the solvothermal reaction of H6BHB (10 mg, 0.018 mmol) and Cu(NO3)2⋅2.5 H2O (20 mg, 0.086 mmol) in N,N‐dimethylformamide (DMF, 1.5 mL) with addition of two drops of HBF4 at 65 °C for 48 hours to give small green block‐shaped crystals (15.8 mg, 69 % yield based on H6BHB). The compound was formulated as [Cu3(BHB)(H2O)3]⋅(DMF)6(H2O)2.5 on the basis of elemental microanalysis.15
