Synthesis of [Mn5L(H2O)6⋅(DMA)2]⋅5 DMA⋅4 C2H5OH: A mixture of H10L (20 mg, 0.015 mmol), MnCl2⋅4H2O (20 mg, 0.10 mmol), DMA (6 mL), ethanol (1 mL), and H2O (0.1 mL) was placed in a Teflon reactor (15 mL) and heated at 150 °C for 72 h. The Teflon reactor was then cooled to room temperature. The dark‐purple crystals were obtained in a 39 % yield based on H10L. Anal. calcd for C112H126Mn5N4O44: C 53.66, H 5.06, N 2.23; found: C 53.45, H 5.11, N 2.15.
