A mixture of Cd(NO3)2·4H2O (0.030 g, 0.10 mmol), H3bpt (0.014 g, 0.05 mmol), and DMA (3 mL) was sealed into a 23 mL Teflon‐lined stainless steel vessel and heated at 120 °C for 4 d. After being slowly cooled to room temperature, colorless block crystals suitable for single crystal X‐ray diffraction were obtained by filtration. Yield: 43 % (based on H3bpt). C38H32Cd3N2O14 (1077.89): calcd. C 42.30; H 2.97; N 2.60 %; found: C 42.34; H 3.02; N 2.55 %. IR (KBr):  = 3435 (m), 2421 (w), 1598 (s), 1487 (s), 1342 (s), 1297 (s), 1203 (m), 1135 (w), 996 (w), 920 (s), 878 (s), 814 (m), 782 (w), 716 (w), 675 (w) cm–1.
