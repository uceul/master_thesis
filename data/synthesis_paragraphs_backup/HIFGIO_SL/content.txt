A mixture containing Zn(NO3)2·6H2O (40 mg, 0.13 mmol), H2L (20 mg, 0.06 mmol), 0.1 mL of 1 M NaOH in 2 mL N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) and 1 mL of EtOH were sealed in a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave and heated under autogenous pressure to 100 °C for 60 h. It was allowed to cool to room temperature at the rate of 1 °C per minute to produce prism shaped colorless crystals of complex 1 in ∼56% yield. The crystals were washed with hot DMF, water, and finally with acetone and air-dried. Anal. calc. for C51H51NO13Zn3: C, 56.61; H, 4.75; N, 1.29%. Found: C, 56.29; H, 4.39; N, 1.12%.
