A mixture of 3,4′-bpdc (0.024 g, 0.1 mmol), Cu(NO3)2·2.5H2O (0.024 g, 0.1 mmol), DMF (7 mL), C2H5OH (1 mL), and H2O (1 mL) in a molar ratio of 1:1:905:171.6:555 was heated at 60 °C for 48 h in a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave (15 mL). After cooling of the sample to room temperature, blue block crystals of 2 were obtained with the yield of 80% based on 3,4′-bpdc. Elemental analysis calcd for 2 C20H33N2O11.5Cu (549.03): C, 43.75; H, 6.06; N, 5.10%; Found: C, 43.67; H, 6.09; N, 5.16%. IR (cm−1): 3423w, 2929w, 1658m, 1621m, 1563m, 1400s, 1100w, 762m, 663w.
