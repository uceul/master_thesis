
A mixture of H2E2Ge2O3 (0.084 g, 0.247 mmol), Tb(NO3)3·6H2O (0.206 g, 0.455 mmol) and 1,2-diaminopropane (0.019 g, 0.256 mmol) was stirred in H2O (10 mL, 556 mmol) for 30 min (pH 6), and then Hpza (0.031 g, 0.250 mmol) was added. The resulting mixture was stirred for 30 min, sealed in a 40 mL Teflon-lined bomb at 170 °C for 7 days and cooled to room temperature. Colorless block crystals of 3 suitable for X-ray diffraction were obtained by filtration, washed with distilled water, and dried in air. Yield: 41% for 3 based on H2E2Ge2O3. Anal. calcd (%) for 3, C51H118N4O88Ge14Tb10: C, 12.76; H, 2.48; N, 1.17. Found: C, 12.72; H, 2.43; N, 1.16. IR (KBr, cm−1): 3426s, 2962w, 2918w, 1600vs, 1442m, 1386m, 1307w, 1159w, 1052w, 1017w, 768vs, 707m, 623w, 543m (Fig. S1).
