A mixture of H4btadpa (0.0025 g, 0.005 mmol), CuI (0.002 g, 0.001 mmol), HBF4 (100 μL), and DMF (1 mL) was sealed in a 20 mL vial and ultrasonically treated for 3 min at room temperature until it changed to a clear solution, then kept in an oven at 85 °C for 24 h, and cooled to room temperature. The green block crystals were collected, washed with DMF, and air-dried (65% yield based on CuI). Anal. Calcd for Cu2C47H75N9O27S: C 41.60; H 5.53; N 9.28, S 2.36%; found: C 42.70; H 5.18; N 10.67, S 1.87%.
