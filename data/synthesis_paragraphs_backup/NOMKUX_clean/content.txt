Syntheses: a mixture of H4SiW12O40·20H2O (0.081 g, 0.025 mmol), AgNO3 (0.017 g, 0.1 mmol), pz (0.012 g, 0.15 mmol) and H2O (8 mL) was stirred for 0.5 h in air. The pH value of the mixture was adjusted to 3.5 with 1.0 mol L− 1 NaOH, then transferred to a Teflon-lined reactor and kept under auto-genous pressure at 160 °C for 3 days. After the autoclave was slowly cooled to room temperature at the rate of 10 °C h− 1, colorless crystals of 1 were obtained. The crystals were filtered, washed with distilled water and dried at room temperature (0.045 g, 47% yield based on Ag). Anal.
