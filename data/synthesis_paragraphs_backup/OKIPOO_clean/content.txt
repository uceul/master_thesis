A mixture of Co(NO3)2·6H2O (29.1 mg, 0.1 mmol), H2bdc (16.6 mg, 0.1 mmol), and BIDPE (30.2 mg, 0.1 mmol) in 12 mL of DMF/H2O (3:1, v/v) was placed in a Parr Teflon-lined stainless steel vessel (15 mL) under autogenous pressure and heated at 90 °C for 3 days. Purple crystals were obtained, and crystals were filtered off, washed with mother liquid, and dried under ambient conditions to give 1 in 66% yield based on BIDPE. Anal. Calcd for C54H44O13N9Co2: C, 56.65; H, 3.87; N, 11.01. Found: C, 56.62; H, 3.85; N, 11.04.
