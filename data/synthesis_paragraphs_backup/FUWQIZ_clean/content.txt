
A mixture of the organic link H4L (15 mg, 0.0356 mmol) and Cu(NO3)2·2.5H2O (30 mg, 0.0645 mmol) was dissolved into 8 mL mixed DMF/H2O solvent (3/1, v/v) in a 20 mL screw-capped vial, then 100 μL HCl (37%, aq.) was added, the mixture was sonicated until homogenous. The vial was capped and placed in a precise oven at 80 °C for 1 day. The resulting blue rhombic shaped crystals were washed with DMF three times to afford ZJU-8 materials. Yield: 68%, calculated based on the ligand. According to the single-crystal structure determination, elemental analyses and thermogravimetric analysis (Fig. S1), ZJU-8 can be formulated as [Cu2(L)(H2O)2]·(DMF)5·(H2O). TGA under a nitrogen atmosphere reveals a weight loss of 43.77% up to 528 K, corresponding to the loss of free DMF and H2O molecules and terminal water molecules (calcd 43.52%). Elemental analysis: calcd (C37H52Cu2N6O16, %): C, 46.10; H, 5.03; N, 8.72; found: C, 46.01; H, 5.31; N, 9.13.
