A mixture of Co(NO3)2·6H2O (58 mg, 0.20 mmol), H4L1 (12 mg, 0.025 mmol), 4-abpt (12 mg, 0.05 mmol), H2O (7.5 mL), DMF (1.5 mL), and three drops of HNO3 (2.0 mol·L–1) was sealed in a 15 mL Teflon-lined reactor and heated at 120 °C for 48 h. Purple crystals of 4 were obtained in 60.0% yield (16.9 mg, 0.015 mmol) based on H4L1. Anal. Calcd for C48H42Co2N12O14: C, 51.07; H, 3.75; N, 14.89. Found: 51.72; H, 4.40; N, 16.19.
