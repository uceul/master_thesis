
A mixture of Co(NO3)2·3H2O (0.1 mmol), TPB (0.05 mmol), H4PMA(0.1 mmol), NaOH (0.4 mmol) and H2O (6 mL) was heated at 120 °C for 3 d. After the mixture had been slowly cooled to room temperature, pink crystals of 3 were obtained (yield: 53% based on Co). Anal. Calcd for C17H18CoN2O7: C 48.42, H 4.23, N 6.49. Found: C 48.31, H 4.30, N 6.31%. IR (cm−1, KBr): 3424 (s), 1615 (s), 1585 (s), 1502 (m), 1445 (m), 1427 (s), 1381 (s), 1318 (s), 1227 (w), 1143 (w), 1070 (w), 1021 (w).
