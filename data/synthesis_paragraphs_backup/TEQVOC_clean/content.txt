
A mixture of zinc acetylacetonate hydrate (1.0 mmol), NH3·H2O (4.0 mmol), barium hydroxide (2.0 mmol) and 5-tert-butylisophthalic acid (1.5 mmol) in 15 mL H2O is stirred for 10 min at room temperature. The mixture is then transferred into a 30 mL, Teflon-lined stainless-steel vessel. The mixture is heated at 210 °C for five days under autogenous pressure. After the reaction mixtures have slowly cooled down to room temperature, colorless sheet crystals of ZnBa-tbip are filtered off, washed with distilled water, and dried in air. Yield: ∼60%.
