The mixture of H2L (21 mg, 0.054 mmol), CdCl2·2.5H2O (30 mg, 0.13 mmol) and 40% HBF4 (4 drops) in DMF (11 ml) were placed in a small vial and heated at 65 °C for 48 h and then cooled to room temperature. Colorless prism crystals of the product were formed and collected by filtration (yield: 0.016 g, 39% based on H2L). Anal. Calc. for CdC20H34N10O14: C, 31.99; H, 4.56; N, 18.65. Found: C, 31.81; H, 4.47; N, 18.74%.
