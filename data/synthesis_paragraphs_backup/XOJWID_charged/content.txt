A mixture of Zn(Ac)2·2H2O (0.112 g, 0.511 mmol), H3pbc (0.095 g, 0.480 mmol), and N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) (5.0 mL) was stirred for dissolution and then heated at 170 °C for 48 h in a Telflon-lined stainless steel autoclave (33 mL). After slow cooling to ambient temperature, transparent stick crystals of 1, accompanied by the formation of unidentified white powder impurities, were obtained. A suitable single crystal of 1 with the size of 0.10 × 0.06 × 0.05 mm3 was selected for X-ray single-crystal characterization.
