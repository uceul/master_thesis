A mixture of MnCl2·(H2O)4 (40 mg, 0.2 mmol) and H4ABTC (11 mg, 0.03 mmol) was dissolved in DMF/glycol/H2O (8:2:1) at room temperature in a 25 mL beaker. Sufficient 2 M HCl was added until the mixture became clear. The mixture was left undisturbed at 55 °C for 2 days to give orange, block-shaped crystals. Yield: 73% (based on H4ABTC). Elemental anal. Calcd C22H22N4O10Mn (557.07): C, 47.39; H, 3.98; N, 10.05. Found: C, 47.26; H, 3.82; N, 10.16.
