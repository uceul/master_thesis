
FBPT (0.045 mmol, 13 mg), Eu(NO3)3·6H2O (0.045 mmol, 20 mg), DMF (2 mL), H2O (1.3 mL) and ethanol (2 mL) were placed in a 10 mL glass vial, which was sealed and heated to 80 °C for 48 h, and then cooled to room temperature at a rate of 10 °C min−1. The pH value of the reaction mixtures changed from 3.6 to 5.5. The colorless crystals formed were collected and air-dried (73% based on FBPT). Anal. calcd (%) for C18H15EuFNO8 (Mr = 544.28): C, 39.72; H, 2.78; N, 2.57; Eu, 27.92. Found: C, 39.48; H, 3.09; N, 2.43; Eu, 28.22.
