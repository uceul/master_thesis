The compound II was prepared from a reaction mixture of InCl3 · 4H2O, H3PO3, piperazine and water with a molar ratio of 0.5:17.1:4.0:666. A typical synthesis procedure begins with mixing 0.16 g InCl3, 1.40 g H3PO3, 0.80 g piperazine hexahydrate, and 12 ml of water to form a reaction mixture. The reaction mixture was stirred for 1 h at room temperature, then the mixture was transferred to a 23 ml PTFE-lined stainless-steel hydrothermal autoclave at a filling capacity of ∼52% and heated at 180 °C for 7 d under autogenous pressure. The product containing block crystals was collected by filtration, washed thoroughly with distilled water, and dried in air at room temperature (51% yield based on In). The agreement between the experimental and simulated XRD patterns indicated the phase purity of the product (Fig. 1b). The difference in reflection intensities between the simulated and experimental patterns was due to the variation in preferred orientation for the powder sample. The ICP and elemental analysis results were also consistent with the theoretical values: C obsd. (%), calcd. (%), 6.70, 6.67; H, 2.72, 2.63; N, 3.90, 3.89; In, 31.89, 31.92; P, 21.58, 21.54.
