
H4L (10.0 mg) and Cu(NO3)2·3H2O (20 mg, 0.1 mmol) were dissolved in 2 mL solvent of DMF in a vessel, to which 20 drops HBF4 were added. The vessel was sealed and heated to 75 °C for 1 day and then cooled to room temperature at a rate of 5 °C per hour. Blue block crystals of NJU-Bai 19 were filtered and washed with DMF. Yield 11.2 mg. Selected IR (cm−1): 3418 (br, s), 1655 (m), 1585 (vs), 1449 (m), 1378 (m), 1243 (w), 1001 (m), 779 (m), 730 (m).
