All commercially available chemicals were analytical reagent grade and used as received without further purification. The ligand of H3L was prepared according to reported procedure [17], and bbi was synthesized by the literature method [18]. Synthesis of compound 1: A mixture of Ce(NO3)3∙ 6H2O (22 mg, 0.05 mmol), H3L (57 mg, 0.10 mmol), bbi (8 mg, 0.05 mmol) were dissolved in 8 mL of mixed solvents of distilled water and DMF (1:1, v/v) in a Teflon reactor (15 ml) and heated at 130 °C for 3 days. After the mixture was gradually cooled to room temperature, colourless prismatic crystals were obtained and collected by filtration, washed with deionized water, then dried in air, 60-80% yield based on Ce(III).
