
A mixture of Co(CH3COO)2·4H2O (25 mg, 0.10 mmol), 4,4′-bpy (14 mg, 0.10 mmol), mellitic acid (20 mg, 0.05 mmol), and H2O (12.0 mL) was heated in a stainless steel reactor with Teflon liner at 140 °C for 24 h and was then cooled slowly. Rosy, rectangular block-like crystals of 2a (68% yield) were obtained intermixed with a few colorless crystals. Calcd (found) for 2a: C, 36.20 (36.46); H, 3.18 (3.11); N, 3.84 (3.57).
