
A mixture of H5DDCBA (4 mg, 0.0089 mmol) and Cu(NO3)2·2.5H2O (8.56 mg, 0.0356 mmol) was dissolved in DMF/H2O (6 mL, 9/1, v/v) in a screw-capped vial. After HNO3 (230 μL) were added to the mixture, the vial was capped and placed in an oven at 80 °C for 72 h. The resulting blue cuboid-shaped single crystals were washed with DMF several times to give ZJU-72. Elemental analysis: calcd for [Cu6(C69H30O30)(H2O)6](C3H7NO)14(H2O)11(C111H150N14O61Cu6): C, 43.89; H, 4.98; N, 6.46; found: C, 43.95; H, 4.79; N, 6.36%.
