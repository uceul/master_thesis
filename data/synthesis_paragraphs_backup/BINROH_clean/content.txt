A mixture of H3BTN (8.3 mg, 14.2 μmol) and Cu(NO3)2·2.5H2O (14.5 mg, 62.3 μmol, Aldrich) was dissolved in a mixed solvent of N,N′-diethylformamide (DEF; 1.0 mL) and H2O (0.1 mL) in a disposable scintillation vial (20 mL). Upon the addition of 10 μL of 6 M HCl, the vial was capped and heated at 90 °C for 24 h. The polyhedral crystals were collected in 71% yield. UTSA-28-Cu was best formulated as [Cu3(BTN)2(H2O)3]·14DEF. Selected FTIR (neat, cm–1): 1653, 1616, 1614, 1482, 1439, 1400, 1398, 1379, 1363, 1309, 1263, 1261, 1216, 1214, 1109, 1107, 944, 922, 879, 822, 781, 764, 754, 705. TGA data. Calcd weight loss for 14DEF and 3H2O: 51.9. Found: 52.4. Anal. Calcd for C148H202N14O29Cu3: C, 62.77; H, 7.19; N, 6.92. Found: C, 63.01; H, 7.23; N, 6.77.
