
A mixture of Cd(OAc)2·2H2O (99 mg), 9-AC (9-anthracenecarboxylic acid, 55 mg), H2BDC (42 mg), NaOH (5 mg), methanol (1 mL) and DMA (4 mL) were mixed and sealed in a 25 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave and heated at 150 °C for 4 days (G = guest solvent molecules). The autoclave was subsequently cooled to room temperature. Colourless crystals were recovered by filtration, washed with DMA and ethanol, and finally dried at ambient temperature (32.5% yield based on H2BDC). CHN elemental analysis: anal. for 1: C 42.35 wt%, H 3.26 wt%, and N 2.65 wt%; calc. for 1: C 42.41 wt%, H 3.16 wt%, and N 2.75 wt%. IR (KBr, cm−1): 3435 (m), 1560 (s), 1502 (m), 1482 (m), 1404 (s), 1379 (m), 1147 (w), 1093 (m), 1015 (m), 948 (m), 825 (m), 744 (m), 509 (m).
