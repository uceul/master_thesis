
A mixture of Cd(NO3)2·4H2O (0.1542 g, 0.5 mmol) and H3PIMDC (0.1842 g, 1.0 mmol) was dissolved in deionized water (8 mL) and stirred for 20 min in air. The solution was transferred into a 25 mL Teflon-lined reactor and heated at 180 °C for 5 days. After the mixture was cooled to room temperature at a rate of 4 °C h−1, yellowish block crystals were obtained in 62% yield. Anal. calcd for C16H16Cd2N4O9 (%): C, 30.33; H, 2.53; N, 8.84.
