Synthesis. A. [N(CH3)4]2Zn3(HPO3)4. A total of 0.3759 g of zinc carbonate, 2.1342 g of water, 2.0302 g of ethylene glycol, 0.7546 g of phosphorous acid, 0.0414 g of hydrogen fluoride−pyridine, and 4.0617 g of tetramethylammonium hydroxide (25 wt % in water) were mixed in a 23 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave and stirred for 45 min. The pH of the resulting mixture was 8.10. The vessel then was sealed and heated at 180 °C for 6 days. After cooling to room temperature, clear bipyramid-shaped crystals (0.5304 g), most of which were microcrystalline, were obtained with a 79.9% yield. Results of the elemental analysis (in wt %) are 14.25 (calcd 14.46) for C, 3.85 (calcd 4.25) for H, and 4.04 (calcd 4.22) for N. The X-ray powder diffraction pattern was consistent with that calculated from single-crystal data, showing no impurity peaks. Microscopic examination using a Nikon SMZ-1500 stereomicroscope showed no amorphous phase.
