
A mixture of Cu(NO3)2·3H2O (0.030 g, 0.12 mmol), H4L·H2O (0.010 g, 0.02 mmol), DMF (2 mL) and 3 drops HBF4 (40% in water) was sealed in a glass vial. The mixture was heated at 75 °C for 36 h, and then cooled to room temperature. Green crystals of 1 were obtained in a 39% yield based on H4L. Anal. calcd (%) for C33H50Cu2N4O18 (1·7H2O·DMF): C 43.18, H 5.49, N 6.10; found (%): C 43.00, H 5.07, N 6.20. IR data (KBr, cm−1): 3425 (b), 2961 (w), 2926 (w), 1655(vs), 1600(s), 1572(m), 1437(m), 1408(s), 1383(m), 1347(m), 1288(m), 1253(m), 1195(m), 1162(m), 1099(m), 993(w), 972(w), 953(w), 765(m).
