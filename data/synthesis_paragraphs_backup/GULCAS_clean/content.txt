The title compound was synthesized by using mild solvothermal conditions under autogenous pressure. Typically, 0.27 g (1 mmol) FeCl3·6H2O was dissolved in a mixture of 6 mL H2O and 3 mL ethanol with stirring, followed by addition of 0.44 mL (4 mmol) DETA and 0.41 g (5 mmol) H3PO3. HF (48%) was added dropwise to the above reaction mixture. After stirring for 30 min, as the final reaction mixture was transferred into a sealed Teflon-lined steel autoclave and heated at 160 °C for 7 days, then slowly cooled to room temperature. The pH of the mixture did not show any appreciable change during the solvothermal reaction and remained at approximately 1.5. The resulting product, light pink stick-like single crystals were separated by filtering, washed with water and acetone, and dried in air. The yield of the reaction was approximately 60% based on iron content.
