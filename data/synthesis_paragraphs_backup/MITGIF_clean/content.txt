Preparation of the Complexes. [{Yb(bbtec)1/4(dbtec)3/6(H2O)2}4· 6H2O]n (1). A mixture of YbCl3·6H2O (0.048 g, 0.125 mmol), 1,2,4,5-benzenetetracarboxylic dianhydride (0.05 g, 0.25 mmol), and H2O (16.0 mL) with a mole ratio of 1:2:7100 was heated in a stainless steel reactor with Teflon liner at 170 °C for 36 h. After cooling, colorless plate crystals of 1 were obtained. Yield:  63%. Anal. Calcd for C30H34O38Yb4:  C, 21.25; H, 2.02. Found:  C, 20.75; H, 2.07.
