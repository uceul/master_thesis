A mixture containing p-cbiaH3 (0.02 g, 0.06 mmol), Co(CH3COO)2·4H2O (0.07 g, 0.39 mmol), and bpmp (0.015 g, 0.06 mmol) in 3 mL of water and 0.1 mL of 1 M NaOH solution were sealed in a Teflon-lined autoclave and heated under autogenous pressure to 130 °C for 2 days and then allowed to cool to room temperature at the rate of 1 °C/min. Block-shaped pink crystals of 1 were collected in ∼56% yield. The crystals were repeatedly washed with water followed by acetone and air-dried. Anal.
