A mixture of H2BPDC (0.250 g, 1 mmol) and dimethyl amide (DMA, 10 mL) was added to Mn(NO3)2·6H2O (0.293 g, 1 mmol) dissolved in DMA (2 mL). The mixture was kept at 434 K for 20 d, and the product formed was not homogeneous. The crystals formed were both block‐shaped and needle‐like colorless crystals. A block‐shaped crystal of 3 was isolated; however, it was not possible to locate a single crystal of the phase with needle‐shaped crystals as these are very fragile.
