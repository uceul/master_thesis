
H4L (13 mg, 0.01 mmol) was transferred into N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF, 2 mL) in a small capped vial and sonicated for ten minutes for dissolution. In(NO3)3·4.5H2O (20 mg, 0.052 mmol), 0.5 mL H2O and formic acid (0.2 mL) were added into the resulting solution and further sonicated for 10 minutes. The vial was placed into a Teflon-lined acid-digestion bomb and heated at 120 °C for 3 days and then allowed to cool to room temperature naturally. Dark purple, rhombic crystals of NUPF-3 were harvested (Fig. S1), followed by washing several times with DMF and ethanol, respectively. Yield: ∼10 mg (∼75%, based on porphyrin ligand). FT-IR (KBr pellet, cm−1): ν = 3404(s), 3124(w), 2366(w), 1657(w), 1599(s), 1520(s), 1398(s), 1318(m), 1251(m), 1170(m), 1102(m), 1006(m), 857(w), 701(m), 636(w), 491(w).
