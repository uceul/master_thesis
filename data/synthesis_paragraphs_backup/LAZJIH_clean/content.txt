A mixture of Zn(NO3)2·6H2O (29.7 mg, 0.1 mmol), H4btc (25.4 mg, 0.1 mmol), and TPOM (22.2 mg, 0.05 mmol) was dissolved in 9 mL of DMF/H2O (1/2, v/v). The final mixture was heated at 100 °C for 2 days. Colorless block crystals were obtained in 78% yield based on TPOM. Anal. Calcd for C45H32Zn2N4O20: C, 50.07%; H, 2.99%; N, 5.19%. Found: C, 49.98%; H, 3.14%; N 5.16%.
