
A mixture containing Htz (21.0 mg, 0.3 mmol) and CuCl2·2H2O (34.0 mg, 0.2 mmol) was dissolved in doubly deionized water (10.0 mL). The initial pH value of the mixture was adjusted to ca. 6.0 using an aqueous NaOH solution (0.25 M). The resulting mixture was then transferred into a Parr Teflon-lined stainless steel vessel (23.0 mL) and heated at 150 °C for 72 h under autogenous pressure. After the mixture was cooled to room temperature at a rate of 2.5 °C h−1, blue block-shaped crystals suitable for X-ray analysis were obtained directly, washed with methanol, and dried in air (Yield: 30% based on Htz). Anal. Calcd for C3H5.67Cl0.33Cu1.67N12O1.33: C 10.33, H 1.64, N 48.17%. Found: C 10.18, H 1.57, N 48.06%. IR (KBr, cm−1): 3398(br), 3120(w), 2961(m), 2860(m), 1654(m), 1448(s), 1325(m), 1239(s), 1137(s), 1157(s), 1061(m), 1024(m), 888(w), 688(w), 495(w).
