Synthesis of 1: A mixture of Co(NO3)2·6H2O (0.0582 g, 0.2 mmol), NH2–H2BDC (0.0362 g, 0.2 mmol) and L (0.0876 g, 0.2 mmol) in DMF (5 mL) was sealed in a Teflon‐lined stainless steel vessel and heated at 115 °C for 4 d. The reaction system was then cooled to room temperature. Red crystals were obtained. Yield: 69 % based on Co(NO3)2·6H2O.
