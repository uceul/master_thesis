Synthesis of Co5(OH)2(O2CCH3)8·2H2O (1). Pyrex tubes were each loaded with Co(acac)3 (0.20 g, 0.56 mmol), H2O (80 μL, 4.4 mmol), and tetrahydrofuran (THF, 2.0 mL). After subjection to two freeze−pump−thaw cycles on a vacuum line, the tubes were sealed at a length of 12 cm and internal volume of 5.8 mL. The tubes were then placed inside an autoclave and 2300 psi of Ar was introduced as counterpressure to prevent bursting during the reaction. After being heated at 255 °C for 5 days, the light tan crystalline product was filtered and washed with petroleum ether under a stream of argon (yield:  0.095 mmol, 85% based on Co). The identity of the bulk sample was confirmed by matching the powder diffraction pattern to that calculated from the single-crystal structure (vide infra). Since the compound decomposes in air over several days to an XRD amorphous pink powder, it was stored in an argon atmosphere drybox. The infrared spectrum consists of a series of very broad bands from 3700 to 2700 and 1600−600 cm-1. Anal. Calcd:  C, 22.96; H, 3.61. Found:  C, 23.01; H, 3.36.
