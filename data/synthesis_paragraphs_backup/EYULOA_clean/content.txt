
Preparation of [Co3(Tda)3(bpp)2]·2DMF—hydrothermal reaction: Co(NO3)2·6H2O (0.30 mmol), H2tda (0.20 mmol), bpp (0.20 mmol), and DMF (15 mL) were stirred for 30 min in air, then transferred and sealed in a 23 mL Teflon-reactor, which is heated at 120 °C for three days and cooled to room temperature. Purple prism crystals were obtained in ca. 61% yield after washing by water and dried in air. Elemental analysis (%) calc.: C, 48.83; H, 3.93; N, 6.83 and S, 7.82. Found: C, 48.48; H, 4.12; N, 6.92; and S, 7.67%. IR (cm−1) selected bands: 3512(m), 2919(m), 2840(w), 1551(s), 1438(w), 1406(s), 1348(s), 1326(m), 1312(m), 1288(m), 1265(m), 1213(w), 1162(m), 1015(w), 951(m), 813(m), 746(m), 673(s), 629(m), 538(m).
