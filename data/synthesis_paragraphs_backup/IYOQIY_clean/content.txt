A mixture of Cd(NO3)2·6H2O (0.06 mmol, 0.02 g), H3TZI (0.05 mmol, 0.012 g), and DMF/EtOH/H2O (4:2:1, 7 mL) was adjusted to pH about 4.0 with 2 M HNO3 and 0.5 M NaOH solution. It was then sealed in a 25 mL Teflon reactor and heated at 120 °C for 72 h. Finally, the mixture was cooled to room temperature and colorless needle crystals were obtained by filtration. The crystals were washed with DMF and dried in the air. (yield: 55% based on Cd). EA (%) Anal. Calc. for C11H12N5O5Cd: C, 32.49; H, 2.98; N, 17.22. Found: C, 32.87; H, 2.74; N, 17.73%.
