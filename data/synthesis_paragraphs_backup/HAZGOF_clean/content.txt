Synthesis. The scandium terephthalate [Sc2(C8H4O4)3] was synthesized under hydrothermal conditions by the reaction of Sc3+ ions with a mixture of terephthalic acid and disodium terephthalate in a 2:2.25:1.5 ratio. In a container, 0.554 g (2 mmol) of scandium acetate hydrate, 0.375 g (2.25 mmol) of terephthalic acid, and 0.31 g (1. 5 mmol) of disodium terephthalate were mixed in 10 mL of distilled water. After addition of o-phenanthroline (o-Phen) (0.360 g), the reaction mixture was stirred to homogeneity in a 25 mL PTFE bottle and sealed in a stainless steel autoclave (PARR). The reaction was carried out at 180 °C for 4 days under autogenous pressure and afterward cooled slowly at a rate of 10 °C h-1. The compound was obtained in good yield (>80%) as a single phase of transparent prismatic crystals without any traces of amorphous impurities. The crystals were filtered off, washed thoroughly with distilled water, ethanol, and acetone, and finally dried at room temperature.
