
Cd(NO3)2·6 H2O (0.0617 g, 0.2 mmol) and H2NH2BDC (0.0362 g, 0.2 mmol) was dissolved in DMF (10 ml), Et3N (0.05 ml) was then added. The mixture was stirred for 30 min in air, and then sealed in a 15-mL Teflon-lined reactor and kept at 160 °C for 120 h. The autoclave was cooled over a period of 12 h at a rate of 10 °C h−1 to room temperature. Yellow hexagonal crystals of 2 were collected by filtration, washed with water, and dried in air (yield 70%, based on Cd). This complex was stable in air without crystal collapsing and insoluble in common organic solvents such as methanol, ethanol, dichloromethane, chloroform and DMSO. Elemental analysis calcd (%) for C42H56Cd3N8O20.5: C, 37.13; H, 4.26; N, 8.45. Found: C, 37.18; H, 4.21; N, 8.39%.
