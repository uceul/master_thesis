To a solution of 0.070 g V2O5 in 8 mL H2O, was added 1.000 g H3PO3 with stirring, followed by the addtion of 0.777 g piperazine. The molar composition of the initial mixture was V2O5:H3PO3:piperazine:H2O=1:30:10:1110. The mixture was further stirred for 30 min and heated at 170 °C for 4 d in a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave (filled up to ∼75% volume capacity) under autogenous pressure, followed by slow cooling down to the ambient temperature. Light-green crystals of the title compound were collected by filtration, washed with distilled water, and air-dried. The yield of product was 40% in weight based on vanadium.
