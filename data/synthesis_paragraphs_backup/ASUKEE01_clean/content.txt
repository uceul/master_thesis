Synthesis of [Cu2(4,4′‐bpy)3](ClO4)2(H2O)2 (2): A mixture of Cu(ClO4)2·6H2O (0.186 g, 0.5 mmol), 4,4′‐bpy (0.096 g, 0.5 mmol), KI (0.083 g, 0.5 mmol), and water (18.0 mL) in the molar ratio of 1:1:1:1000 was sealed in a 25‐mL stainless steel reactor with Teflon liner, and heated directly to 180 °C. After being kept at 180 °C for 72 h, it was cooled slowly to 30 °C at a rate of 2 °C/h. The resulting brown block crystals of complex 2 were washed and dried in air (yield ca. 15 % based on Cu). C15H14ClCuN3O5 (830.56): calcd. C 43.34, H 3.37, N 10.11; found C 42.98, H 3.51, N 9.89. IR (KBr):  = 3392, 3075, 3044, 1600, 1530, 1483, 1409, 1322, 1217, 1087, 818, 799, 673, 625, 473.
