NPC-4 was synthesized by solvothermal reaction of TMBDI and Cu(NO3)2·3H2O in the solution of DMA and H2O with the addition of HNO3. TMBDI (0.092 g, 0.2 mmol) and Cu(NO3)2·3H2O (0.096 g, 0.4 mmol) were dissolved in DMA/H2O (3:1, 24 mL), and then 2 mL of concentrated HNO3 was added. The resulting mixture was transferred into a 50 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel container and was heated to 373 K for 72 h. After cooling to room temperature at a rate of 0.05 K min–1, the pure phase of blue crystals was obtained and separated by filtration. A typical scanning electron micrograph of the crystals is shown in Supporting Information (see Figure S2). Anal. Calcd (Found, %): C, 46.8 (47.2), H, 5.46 (5.65), N, 3.53 (3.62). IR (KBr): ν(cm–1) = 1629 (vs), 1510 (w), 1433 (m), 1384 (vs), 1258 (m), 1183 (w), 1090 (w), 1047 (w), 919 (w), 874 (w), 773 (m), 731 (m) (see Figure S12, Supporting Information). The compound was formulated as [Cu2(TMBDI)(H2O)2](DMA)2.5(H2O)4 on the basis of single-crystal X-ray diffraction, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and elemental analysis.
