(NH4)2[(UO2)6O2(OH)6(btca)]·5.66H2O (2). 1.0 mL of uranyl nitrate solution (0.5 M), 1 mL of (NH4)2C2O4 solution (0.5 M), 1 mL of Li4btca solution (0.25 M) and 3.0 mL of DI water were added in a 120 mL Teflon container, sealed inside a stainless steel pressure vessel and left in a 180 °C oven for 72 h. Yellow fine needle-type crystalline product of 2, together with some yellow precipitate, was formed after slow cooling (5 °C/h) to room temperature.
