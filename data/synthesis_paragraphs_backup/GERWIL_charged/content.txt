A mixture of Zn(NO3)2·6H2O (0.030 g, 0.1 mmol) and H8L (0.0138 g, 0.02 mmol) in 4 mL of EtOH, 1 mL of DMF and three drops of HCl (6 mol/L) was sealed in an autoclave equipped with a Teflon linear (25 mL), heated at 140 °C for 3 days, and then cooled to room temperature. Yellow block single crystals of 2 were collected in a ca. 21% yield based on H8L. Elemental analysis for C82H102Si2Zn5O42N8, calcd (%): C, 43.68; H, 4.56; N, 4.97.
