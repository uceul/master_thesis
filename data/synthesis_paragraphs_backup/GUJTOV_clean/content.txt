CuCl2·2H2O (63 mg, 0.37 mmol), MoO3 (53 mg, 0.37 mmol), and 4,4′-dpk (136 mg, 0.74 mmol) were added to 10 mL of distilled H2O in a 23 mL Teflon lined Parr acid digestion bomb. The bomb was sealed, heated to 120 °C for 66 h, and then gradually cooled to 23 °C. Green crystals of 1 (76 mg, 0.11 mmol, 30% yield based on Cu) were obtained after manual separation from some flocculent purple powder, washing with distilled water and acetone, and drying in air. Crystals of 1 were stable indefinitely in air. Anal. Calc. for C11H12Cu2Mo2N2O11 (1): C, 19.80; H, 1.81; N, 4.20. Found: C, 19.14; H, 1.67; N, 3.99%. IR (cm−1): 3354 w, br, 1677 m, 1617 w, 1553 w, 1505 w, 1421 m, 1331 w, 1283 m, 1232 w, 1161 w, 1066 w, 924 m, 860 s, 788 s, 758 w, 689 s, 652 s. Crystal data for 1: {[Cu2(MoO4)2(4,4′-dpk)(H2O)]·H2O}n, M = 667.19 g mol−1, monoclinic, space group P2/c, a = 10.7367(16) Å, b = 5.8821(9) Å, c = 27.792(4) Å, β = 97.811(2)°, V = 1738.9(5) Å3, Z = 4. Refinement of 266 parameters on 4028 independent reflections out of 18,536 measured reflections (Rint = 0.0304) led to R1 = 0.0225, wR2 = 0.0489 (all data) and S = 1.091. The hydrogen atoms bound to the water molecules were found by Fourier difference map, and restrained at fixed distances. See supporting data for more detailed crystallographic information.
