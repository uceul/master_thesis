Linker H43 (0.050 g, 0.10 mmol) was added to a solution of NMP/dioxane/H2O (4:1:1, 10 mL) in a 20-mL scintillation vial. To this mixture, Cu(NO3)2·2.5H2O (0.096 g, 0.41 mmol) was added, and the contents were sonicated until dissolved and then heated at 85 °C. After 24 h, the mother liquor was decanted and replaced with fresh NMP/dioxane/H2O (4:1:1). Blue blade-like crystals were washed twice with DMF and five times with acetone. Solvent was removed under vacuum for 4 h and further dried at 100 °C for 18 h to yield a dark-purple material. The yield of the reaction based upon the weight of the solvent-free material is 55% based upon H43. Anal. Calcd (Found) for [Cu2(C28H14O8)(H2O)1.5]: C, 53.17 (53.37) H, 2.71 (2.50).
