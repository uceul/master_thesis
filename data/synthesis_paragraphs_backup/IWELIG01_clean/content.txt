‡ Experimental data for 1: a mixture of Co(OAC)2·4H2O (0.6 mmol), hypoxanthine (0.6 mmol), NaOH aqueous solution (0.6 mL, 1 M) and distilled water (10 mL) was placed in an 18 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel vessel and stirred about 15 min in air. The vessel was sealed and heated at 130 °C for 4 d under autogenous pressure, and then cooled to room temperature naturally. Purple block crystals of 1 were obtained (60% yield based on Co).
