
A mixture of MnCl2·4H2O (0.16 mmol, 32 mg), H3(bcbob) (0.08 mmol, 34 mg), bpp (0.08 mmol, 17 mg) and water (10 mL) (neutralized to pH = 6 by dilute NaOH) was heated to 150 °C in a Teflon-lined stainless steel vessel under autogenous pressure for 4 days, and subsequently cooled to room temperature. The colorless block crystals of 3 were collected, washed with water, and dried in air. Yield: ca. 20% based on Mn(II). Anal. calcd for C59H60N8O16Ni23: C, 61.95; H, 4.21; N, 7.81. Found: C, 61.69; H, 3.97; N, 7.66%. IR (cm−1): 1591 (s), 1557 (s), 1399 (s), 1373 (s), 1300 (m), 1139 (s), 1041 (m), 854 (w), 821 (w), 775 (m), 756 (w), 708 (w), 629 (w).
