Crystals of 1 and 2 were observed to form concurrently when a reaction mixture of zinc lactate (0.122 g, 0.5 mmol), Ga2O3 (0.047 g, 0.25 mmol), 5 m H3PO3 (0.6 mL, 3 mmol), DADD (0.4 g, 2 mmol), HF (40 %, 0.2 mL), and water (10 mL) was heated at 120 °C for 2 days. As the dwelling time was extended to 3 days, crystals of 2 were unobserved in the product; instead, 1 was obtained as a major product, indicating that 1 was more thermally stable between the two phases. Unfortunately, most crystals of 1 were contaminated by unknown grains embedded deep inside, making it difficult to obtain the pure phase of 1. In contrast, 2 was prepared as a pure phase (see the Experimental Section) with a yield of 85 % based on Zn, allowing us to further investigate its interesting properties. Single‐crystal structure analysis was performed to determine the structures and chemical formulae (Table S2 and Figure S1 in the Supporting Information),9 which were corroborated by elemental analysis (EA) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) (Figure S3). The EA data confirmed the stoichiometry of organic amines for 2. The found/calculated percentages were C, 15.64/15.43; H, 4.61/4.20; and N, 3.15/2.99.
