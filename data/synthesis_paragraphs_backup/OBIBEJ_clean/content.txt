
H3TCMTB (0.085 g, 0.15 mmol), CaCl2 (0.034 g, 0.30 mmol), N,N′-dimethylformamide (7.5 g) and H2O (1.5 g) were mixed and the mixture was stirred for half an hour. The resulting homogeneous mixture was then transferred to a 25 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave and heated at 120 °C for 5 days. Needle-like colourless crystals were obtained upon cooling the mixture to room temperature as described above. Yield: 0.14 g, 82% based on H3TCMTB used. Mp: >250 °C.
