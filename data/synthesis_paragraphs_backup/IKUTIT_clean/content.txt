
Compound 1 was obtained by solvothermal methods through the following procedure: 2 ml solution of DMF containing 0.05 mmol of ligand 2,5-diaminoterephthalic acid (9 mg) is prepared in a vial of 8 ml of volume. To this solution, 2 ml of DMF containing 0.05 mmol of Dy(NO3)3·6H2O (22.8 mg) is added. The reaction mixture was heated in a closed vial at 95 °C in an oven for 24 h. Pale yellow crystals were obtained. Yield: 31% based on Dy(III) ion. Elemental analysis of C39H55Dy2N11O18 (1), calcd: C 40.10, H 3.53, N 8.91; found: C 39.95, H 3.72, N 8.54.
