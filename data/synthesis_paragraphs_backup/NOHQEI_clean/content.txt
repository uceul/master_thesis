Ligand H3TATB (0.6 mmol), In(NO3)3⋅x H2O (0.4 mmol) and tetraethylammonium chloride (0.4 mmol) were dissolved in DEF (6 mL). The mixture was placed in a 20 mL vial and heated at 120 °C for 3 days and then cooled to RT within one day. After washing with ethanol (three times), colorless crystals were obtained with about 86 % yield based on InIII.
