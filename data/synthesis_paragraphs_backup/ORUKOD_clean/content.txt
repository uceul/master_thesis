A mixture of the ligand (5.0 mg, 5.2 μmol), and Ba(NO3)2 (5.0 mg, 19.1 μmol) was dissolved in a mixed solvent of DMF (1.0 mL), ethanol (0.5 mL) and water (0.5 mL) in a 20 mL vial. After 15 μL of 6 M HCl was added, the vial was capped. The vial was heated at 373 K for 60 h. The colorless, long strip-shaped crystals were obtained in 40% yield based on the ligand. Based on single-crystal X-ray structure determination, TGA and microanalysis, the barium compound can be best formulated to be [Ba3L(DMF)(H2O)4]·DMF·2H2O. Selected FTIR (KBr, cm−1): 1662, 1601, 1547, 1504, 1402, 1271, 1211, 1180, 1155, 1097, 1016, 956, 889, 865, 792, 758, 740, 698, 619, 540, 505, 474; Anal. Calcd. for C48H50N5O26P3Ba3: C, 35.63; H, 3.12; N, 4.33. Found: C, 35.78; H, 3.11; N, 4.52.
