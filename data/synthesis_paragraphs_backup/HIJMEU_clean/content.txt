The compound 1 was hydrothermally synthesized under autogenous pressure. A mixture of Mn(OAc)2 · 4H2O (0.1 g), Dy(OAc)3 · 10H2O (0.1 g), (NH4)6Mo7O24 · 4H2O (0.2 g), ethylenediamine (0. 3 ml), and water (10 ml) was neutralized to pH 5 with H3PO4 under continuous stirring and sealed in a 15 ml Teflon-lined autoclave, which was heated to 180 °C for five days. After slow cooling to room temperature, red block crystals of 1 were separated as a major phase (75% yield based on Mo) together with a small amount of an unidentified white powder. Anal. Calc.
