{[Zn3(BTC)2(bimh)]·(bimh)}n (1): A mixture containing Zn(OAC)2·2H2O (21.9 mg, 0.10 mmol), H3BTC (21.0 mg, 0.10 mmol), bimh (24.6 mg, 0.10 mmol), and water (10 mL) and ethanol (2 mL) was sealed in a Teflon reactor (20 mL), heated at 150 °C for 3 days, and subsequently cooled to room temperature at 10 K·h–1. Colorless crystals of 1 were collected in a 74 % yield [based on Zn(OAC)2·2H2O]. C23H25ZnN4O6: calcd. C 53.19, H 4.81, N 10.79 %; found: C 53.15, H 4.78, N 10.82 %. IR (KBr):  = 3445 w, 2925 w, 2857 w, 1636 s, 1577 m, 1409 m, 1332 s, 1807 m, 931 m, 757 m, 714 s cm–1.
