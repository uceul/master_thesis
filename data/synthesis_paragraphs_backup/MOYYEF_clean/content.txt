Blue-green block crystals of 1 were obtained by the low-temperature solvothermal reaction. For a typical preparation, a mixture of 3,4′-bpdc (0.024 g, 0.1 mmol), Cu(NO3)2·2.5H2O (0.024 g, 0.1 mmol), DMF (3 mL), C2H5OH (3 mL), and H2O (3 mL) in a molar ratio of 1:1:388:515:1667 was heated at 60 °C for 48 h in a Telflon-lined stainless steel autoclave (15 mL). After cooling of the sample to room temperature, crystals of 1 were obtained with a yield of 80% based on 3,4′-bpdc. Elemental analysis calcd for 1 C17H21NO8Cu (430.90): C, 47.38; H, 4.91; N, 3.25%. Found: C, 46.68; H, 5.07; N, 3.22%. IR (cm−1): 3416w, 2929m, 1659m, 1618m, 1563m, 1402s, 1100w, 762m, 694w.
