Synthesis of UTSA‐36: A mixture of 4‐(4‐pyridyl) benzoic acid (0.02 g, 0.1 mmol), terephthalic acid (0.0083 g, 0.05 mmol) and [Zn(NO3)2⋅6H2O] (0.06 g, 0.2 mmol) in DMF (3 mL) was sonicated for 10 min and heated in a 20 mL scintillation vial with a screw cap at 90 °C for 24 h. Colorless block‐shaped crystals were collected, washed with DMF and dried in air with 82 % yield. Elemental analysis calcd (%) for [Zn2(PBA)2(BDC)⋅(DMF)3(H2O)4] (C41H49N5O15Zn2): C 50.07, H 4.98, N 7.13; found: C 50.55, H 4.51, N 7.34.
