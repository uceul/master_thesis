
A mixture of BeSO4·4H2O (0.089 g), H3PO4 (0.115 g, 85 wt%), 4,4′-bipyridine (0.078 g), and methanol (4.0 mL) was sealed in a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave and heated at 180 °C for 10 days. The autoclave was subsequently allowed to cool to room temperature. Light-pink crystals were recovered by filtration, washed with distilled water, and finally dried at ambient temperature (33.9% yield based on beryllium). IR (KBr pellets, cm−1): 3130(w), 3060(w), 1640(m), 1570(w), 1510(w), 1440(w), 1120(s), 833(m), 708(m), 494(m).
