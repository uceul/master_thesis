
A solution of L-proline (18.3 mg) in ethanol (0.5 mL) was added dropwise to IRMOF-3 (0.2 g), and stored overnight at room temperature. The samples were dried in vacuum at 30 °C to yield IRMOF-3–Pr(PM). IRMOF-3–Pr(OP) was prepared by a mixture of Zn(NO3)2·6H2O (1.0 mmol, 300 mg), H2atpt (0.5 mmol, 93.0 mg), and L-proline (0.5 mmol, 57.5 mg) dissolved in 20 mL DMF and 20 mL ethanol. The mixture was heated in a teflon-lined steel vessel for 24 h at 100 °C. Then the yellow crystals were washed with DMF and CHCl3 during three days, and the product was dried in vacuum at 30 °C. Specifically, IRMOF-3–Pr′(OP) were synthesized by using 0.25 mmol L-proline and a same procedure with IRMOF-3–Pr(OP).
