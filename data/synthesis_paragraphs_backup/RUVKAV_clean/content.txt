Cu(NO3)2·3H2O (10 mg, 0.040 mmol), H4BDDC (5 mg, 0.013 mmol), DMF (1 mL), EtOH (0.5 mL), H2O (0.5 mL), and HNO3 (0.2 mL, 2.7 M in DMF) were added to a 20 mL vial; then the solution was heated to 85 °C for 12 h to give green, block-shaped crystals (5.7 mg, 64% yield based on H4BDDC). The agreement between the experimental and simulated powder X-ray diffraction patterns indicated the phase purity of the as-synthesized product (see Supporting Information Figure S2). Elemental analysis: found (wt%) C 41.25, H 3.09, N 2.26; calcd (wt%) C 41.57, H 3.49, N 2.11.
