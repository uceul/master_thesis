To a red solution of [Et4N]4[WS4Cu4I8] (1051 mg, 0.5 mmol) in MeCN (4 mL) was added a DMF (2 mL) solution containing timtz (558 mg, 2.0 mmol) ligand, and the final mixture was sealed in a 15 mL PTFElined stainlesssteel acid digestion bomb and heated at 75 °C for 2 days. Red prismshaped single crystals suitable for Xray diffraction were obtained several days later in 32% yield.
