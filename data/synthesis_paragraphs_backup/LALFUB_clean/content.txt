
A mixture of 5-methylpyrazine-2-carboxylic acid (0.138 g, 1 mmol), Eu2O3 (0.176 g, 0.5 mmol), HNO3 (0.16 mL), and H2O (10 mL) was heated to 150 °C for 24 h in a 23 mL Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave, followed by cooling to room temperature at 5 °C h−1 to yield yellow block single crystals of 1 (yield: 52%, based on Eu). Elemental analysis (%) calcd for 1 (C14H28Eu2N4O24), C 17.84, H 3.01, N 5.99. Found: C 17.87, H 2.98, N 5.96. Main IR frequencies (KBr, cm−1): 3430, 2919, 2853, 1628, 1462, 1380, 1324, 1189, 1048, 841, 778, 722, 521.
