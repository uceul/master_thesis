[Mg3(ndc)3(dmf)4] (2): A mixture of Mg(NO3)2·6H2O (1.5 g, 5.85 mmol) and 2,6‐naphthalenedicarboxylic acid (0.9 g, 4.16 mmol) in dmf (60 mL) was filled in a 250‐mL Teflon liner, placed in an autoclave, heated to 383 K for 24 h, and then cooled to room temperature at a rate of 0.05 K min–1. The resulting pale‐yellow crystals were collected, washed with dmf, and dried under argon to give 2. Yield: 0.9 g (64.2 %). C48H46Mg3N4O16 (1007.8): calcd. C 57.21, H 4.60, N 5.56; found C 56.77, H 4.36, N 5.81. IR: νC=O = 1680 (s), 1655 (s), 1621 (s), 1566 (s), 1497 (m), 1406 (vs), 1359 (m) cm–1.
