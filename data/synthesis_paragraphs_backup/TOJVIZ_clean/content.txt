The polymer was synthesized by hydrothermal methods. A mixture of Co(NO3)2·6H2O (0.3 mmol), 1,4-naphthalenedicarboxylate acid (1,4-H2NDC) (0.1 mmol), 4,4′-bipyridine-N,N′-dioxide (4,4′-dpdo) hydrate (0.1 mmol), NaOH (0.2 mmol) and distilled water (15 mL) was stirred for 1 h. The mixture was then transferred to a 25 mL Teflon-lined steel autoclave and kept at 160 °C for 5 days under autogenous pressure. After the mixture had been slowly cooled down to room temperature, red block crystals were obtained and washed with distilled water. Yield: ca. 72% (based on 1,4-H2NDC). Anal.
