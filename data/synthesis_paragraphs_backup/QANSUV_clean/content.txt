A mixture of Cu(NO3)2·3H2O (0.3 mmol, 0.0730 g), H2btca (0.2 mmol, 0.0330 g), NaCl (0.05 mmol, 0.003 g), MeCN (4.0 mL), and H2O (2.0 mL) was put into a 15-mL Teflon-lined stainless autoclave and heated to 140 °C for three days (volume ratio of MeCN/H2O ≈ 2:1). This was then slowly cooled to room temperature. Glaucous block crystals of 3 were obtained in about 55% yield (0.0304 g) based on H2btca.
