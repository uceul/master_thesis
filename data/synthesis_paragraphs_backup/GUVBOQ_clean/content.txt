‡ Synthesis and activation of 1: Zn(NO3)·6H2O (0.045 g, 0.15 mmol), H3L (0.024 g, 0.05 mmol), triethylene diamine (0.033 g, 0.15 mmol) and 15 mL of H2O were added into a 20 mL scintillation vial. The mixture was sonicated at room temperature until clear and then transferred to a 25 mL Teflon-lined steel autoclave. The autoclave was sealed, gradually heated to 140 °C within 12 h and then kept at this temperature for 72 h. After slowly cooling down to room temperature within 48 h, colorless column crystals were obtained. The crystals were filtered out and washed with distilled water 3 times. The solvent within the pores of the resulting solid was removed under dynamic vacuum at 100 °C for 5 h. Yield: 31% (based on H3L). IR (cm–1): 3423br, 1628m, 1581s, 1508m, 1414s, 1363m, 1257m, 1196m, 1163w, 958w, 831w, 785w. w = weak, s = strong, m = medium, br = broad. Anal. calcd. for C162H110O64Zn9: C, 53.03; H, 3.02%. Found: C, 53.26; H, 3.58%.
