Typically, zinc acetate (0.22 g, 1 mmol), was first dissolved in the water (8 mL), and then cyclohexylamine (0.38–0.41 mL, 3.2–3.4 mmol) and phosphorous acid (0.205 g, 2.5 mmol, 85%) were added with stirring. A homogeneous reaction gel was formed after stirring for 2 h, and then was sealed in a 15 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave heated at 160 °C for 5 days under static conditions. The final product containing colorless, rod-shaped single crystals was washed with distilled water, and then dried in air.
