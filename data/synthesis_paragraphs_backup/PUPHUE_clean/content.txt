A mixture of Cd(CH3COO)2·2H2O (0.135 g, 0.5 mmol) and H2L (0.172 g, 0.5 mmol) were dissolved in water (12 ml) and ethanol (3 ml), the pH of the solution was adjusted to be about 6–7 with 0.2 mol L−1 aqueous NaOH, then the mixed solution was stirred for 30 min at room temperature, transferred to and sealed in a 25 ml Teflon-lined stainless steel reactor, and then heated at 140 °C for 72 h, upon cooling to room temperature, colorless acicular single crystals were collected and dried in air. Yield: 40% (based on Cd). Anal. Calcd. for C19H22CdO8: C, 46.50; H, 4.52. Found: C, 46.39; H, 4.43. IR (KBr, cm−1): 3410(s), 2928(w), 2849(w), 1607(m), 1563(s), 1512(s), 1434(m), 1339(s), 1248(s), 1188(m), 1073(m), 835(m), 737(w), 570(w).
