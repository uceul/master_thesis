Synthesis of [H3O][V3F2(H2O)2{O3P(CH2)2PO3}2]·3.5H2O (5·3.5H2O). A mixture of VOSO4 (0.224 g, 1.37 mmol), 1,2-ethylenediphosphonic acid (0.174 g, 0.916 mmol), diethylene triamine (0.100 g, 0.969 mmol), H2O (10.00 g, 556 mmol), and HF (0.350 mL, 10.14 mmol) with the mole ratio of 1.50:1.00:607:1.06:11.1. The mixture was stirred briefly before heating to 100 °C for 48 h with an initial and final pH of 1.5 and 1.5, respectively. Black crystals of 5·3.5H2O suitable for X-ray diffraction were isolated in 75% yield. IR (KBr pellet, cm-1):  3400(b), 1637(m), 1509(m), 1459(w), 1420(w), 1196(m), 990(s), 750(m), 511(m). Anal. Calcd for C2H9FO9.25P2V1.5 (Found):  F, 5.61 (4.33).
