Dy(NO3)3·6H2O (91 mg, 0.20 mmol) dissolved in DMF (10 mL) was added to a solution of N-H2BDC (60 mg, 33 mmol) in DMF (10 mL) in a glass tube (Duran culture tube, diameter 18 mm, height 180 mm). The tube was sealed; the contents were well mixed and then placed in an oven at 120 °C for 20 h, resulting in the formation of single crystals in good yield (75 mg, 66%). The crystals were filtered, washed with a little DMF (∼5 mL), and then dried in the vacuum oven for 15 min. After drying, it appears that the material takes up atmospheric water molecules (see the Infrared Spectra section below). Anal. found for [Dy2(N-BDC)3(dmf)4]∞·H2O: C, 36.43; H, 4.39; N, 8.75%. Calcd: C, 36.87; H, 3.87; N, 8.36%. The deviations for %H and %N might be due to traces of remaining DMF. Selected IR data (Neat): 3471 (w) ν(OH), 3349 (w) ν(NH), 2936 (w) ν(CH), 1666 (m) ν(CO), 1654 (m) νas(COO), 1541 (m) ν(C═C), 1497 (m) νs(COO), 1419 (m) ν(CO), 1373 (s) ν(CN), 1253 (m) ν(CO), 771 (s) δ(OCO), 677 (s) δ(═CH) cm−1. The crystals were analyzed by single-crystal X-ray diffraction and by X-ray powder diffraction.
