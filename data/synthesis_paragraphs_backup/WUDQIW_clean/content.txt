
The single crystals of complex 1 were prepared by solvothermal reaction: a mixture of NiCl2·6H2O (2 mmol) and sodium 1,2,4-triazolylacetate (Na+L−) (4 mmol) in 15 mL EtOH:H2O (v:v = 1:1) was sealed in a Teflon-lined stainless steel vessel (25 mL), heated at 140 °C for 2 days under autogenous pressure, and then cooled to room temperature. Blue block crystals of 1 were harvested in ca. ∼25% yield based on NiII ions. Anal. calcd for C4H8NiN3O4Cl: C, 18.75; H, 3.15; N, 16.40. Found: C, 18.43; H, 3.41; N, 16.18%.
