The resulting small flaky colorless X-ray-quality crystals were collected manually and dried in air (yield: 18% based on [PR63]2+·2[NO3]−). Elemental analysis calc. For C144H164N58O72Cd5 (%): C, 39.12; N, 18.37; H, 3.74; Cd. 12.71; found (%): C, 38.89; N. 18.14; H, 4.05; Cd. 12.48. IR (cm−1, major absorbances): 3441 (w), 1737 (s), 1614 (s), 1557 (s), 1472 (s), 1374 (s), 1234(s), 1188 (s), 964 (s), 801 cm−1 (s).
