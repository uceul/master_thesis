CuI (4.76 mg, 0.025 mmol) and H2-4,5-pmbc (10 mg, 0.05 mmol) were added to a 3 mL solution of DMF and 1 mL of CH3CN in a 20 mL scintillation vial heated to 85 Â°C for 48 h and cooled to room temperature. The as-synthesized green hexagon-like crystals are insoluble in water and common organic solvents.
