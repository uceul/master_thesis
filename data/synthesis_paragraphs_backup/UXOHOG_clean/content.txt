Synthesis of m‐NB13: A mixture of CuCl2·2H2O (17.05 mg, 0.1 mmol), H3CMPEIP (6.2 mg, 0.02 mmol), and DMA/methanol/H2O (5:3:1, 1.8 mL) was stirred for 10 min in air and was then sealed in a 20 mL Teflon‐lined autoclave, which was heated at 80 °C for 48 h. After cooling to room temperature, green hexagonal‐plate‐shaped crystals were obtained, yield 60.8 %.
