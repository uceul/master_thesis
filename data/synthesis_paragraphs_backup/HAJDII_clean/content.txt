
A mixture of Tb(NO3)2·6H2O (0.046 g, 0.1 mmol), H2oba (0.026 g, 0.1 mmol), Hatz (0.042 g, 1 mmol), DMF (2 mL), and H2O (2 mL) was sealed in a 5 mL glass bottle and heated at 80 °C for 72 h under autogenous pressure. After cooling to room temperature, colorless block crystals suitable for X-ray diffraction analysis were obtained. The yield was 60% for 1 (based on H2oba ligand). Elemental analysis calcd (%) for 1 (C32H31N5O11.5Tb): C, 46.39; H, 3.77; N, 8.45; found: C 46.53, H 3.62, N 8.32. Elemental analysis calcd (%) for activated 1 (C32H28N5O10Tb): C, 47.95; H, 3.52; N, 8.74; found: C 48.02, H 3.36, N 8.91.
