
A mixture of Cd(NO3)2·4H2O (0.05 mmol, 0.015 g), H22TDC (0.05 mmol, 0.009 g), L (0.05 mmol, 0.016 g) and water (8 mL) was adjusted to pH = 5.8 by NH3·H2O, and then heated at 120 °C in Teflon-lined autoclaves for 3 days, followed by slow cooling to room temperature. The resulting colorless prismatic crystals were filtered off (yield: ca. 45% based on Cd). Elemental Anal. Found: C, 45.29; H, 3.21; N, 8.83%. Calcd for C48H40Cd2N8O16S2: C, 45.26; H, 3.17; N, 8.80%. IR (KBr, cm−1): 3425(s), 2356(w), 1670(s), 1589(m), 1508(m), 1423(s), 1373(m), 1330(m), 1296(m), 1261(w), 1213(s), 1116(s), 1064(w), 1018(s), 889(m), 864(w), 829(s), 777(s), 711(m), 605(s), 534(s), 460(m).
