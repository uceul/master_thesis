Synthesis of [Cu2(4,4′‐bpy)2Cl](ClO4) (1): A mixture of Cu(ClO4)2·6H2O (0.186 g, 0.5 mmol), pyrazine‐2,3‐dicarboxylic acid (0.084 g, 0.5 mmol), 4,4′‐bpy (0.096 g, 0.5 mmol), CuCl2 (0.017 g, 0.1 mmol), and water (18.0 mL) in the molar ratio of 5:5:5:1:10000 was sealed in a 25‐mL stainless steel reactor with Teflon liner, and heated directly to 180 °C. After being kept at 180 °C for 72 h, it was cooled slowly to 30 °C at a rate of 2 °C/h. From a large quantity of red deposit, the resulting orange block crystals of 1 were separated, washed, and dried in air (yield ca. 10 % based on Cl). Replacing pyrazine‐2,3‐dicarboxylic acid by equivalent pyridine‐2,6‐dicarboxylic acid, the same crystals were obtained (yield ca. 5 % based on Cl). C10H8ClCuN2O2 (287.17): calcd. C 41.83, H 2.81, N 9.76; found C 41.65, H 2.55, N 9.52. The pH value of the residuary solution is 4. IR (KBr):  = 3441, 3070, 3042, 1635, 1601, 1526, 1482, 1408, 1326, 1215, 1109, 1084, 963, 817, 799, 724, 673, 625, 475.
