
A mixture of H2E2Ge2O3 (0.078 g, 0.232 mmol), Dy2O3 (0.093 g, 0.249 mmol), Hpza (0.140 g, 1.128 mmol) and HCOONa·2H2O (0.026 g, 0.25 mmol) was stirred in H2O (10 mL, 556 mmol) for 30 min (pH 3), sealed in a 40 mL Teflon-lined bomb at 170 °C for 7 days and cooled to room temperature. Colorless block crystals of 6 suitable for X-ray diffraction were obtained by filtration, washed with distilled water and dried in air. Yield: 43% for 6 based on H2E2Ge2O3. Anal. calcd (%) for 6, C77H103N16O81Ge12Dy11: C, 17.76; H, 1.99; N, 4.30. Found: C, 17.73 H, 1.95; N, 4.26. IR (KBr, cm−1): 3414s, 2957w, 1633s, 1588vs, 1431m, 1380m, 1294w, 1165m, 1035m, 860w, 769vs, 606w, 532m (Fig. S1).
