A mixture of Cd(CH3COO)2·3H2O (0.046 g, 0.20 mmol), H6L (0.144 g, 0.20 mmol), imidazole (0.013 g, 0.20 mmol), and methanol/water (V1:1, 10 mL) was placed in a Teflon reactor. The mixture was heated at 120 °C for 3 days, and then it was gradually cooled to room temperature. The crystals were obtained in a 38% yield. Anal.
