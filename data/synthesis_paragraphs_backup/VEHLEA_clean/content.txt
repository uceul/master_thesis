B. [HN(CH3)3]2Zn3(HPO3)4. A total of 0.3750 g of zinc carbonate, 1.9388 g of water, 1.5198 g of ethylene glycol, 0.7569 g of phosphorous acid, 0.0611 g of hydrogen fluoride−pyridine, and 3.737 g of trimethylamine (25∼27 wt % in water) were mixed together and stirred for 45 min in a 23 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave to reach a pH of 9.38. The vessel then was sealed and heated at 120 °C for 5 days. After cooling to room temperature, plate-shaped clear crystals were found mixed with an unidentified polycrystalline powder. The X-ray powder diffraction pattern showed the presence of an unidentified crystalline phase that occurred as a minor phase on the basis of diffraction intensity.
