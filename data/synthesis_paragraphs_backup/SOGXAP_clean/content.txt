A 25 mL Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave charged with 0.308 g (1.8 mmol) CeO2 and 0.304 g (2 mmol) meso-tartaric acid in 18 mL H2O was heated at 140 °C for 5 days and cooled to room temperature at a rate of 5 °C/h. After suction filtration, 0.31 g colorless needle-like crystals were obtained (46% on the basis of the initial CeO2 input). The product phase purity was also checked according to the experimental PXRD. Anal. Calc. for C8H6CeO10 (380.24): C, 25.27; H, 1.59%. Found: C, 24.87; H, 1.83%. IR spectrum (KBr pellet, ν/cm−1): 3416m, 3085m, 1628s, 1591vs, 1443w, 1384m, 1348m, 1251m, 1103w, 1107m, 1053m, 797w, 761w, 544w, 501w.
