A mixture of CuCl2·2H2O (36.0 mg, 0.2 mmol), H4L2 (17.2 mg, 0.05 mmol), DMF (2 mL), and H2O (6 mL) was sealed in a 15 mL Teflon-lined reactor. The reactor was heated at 100 °C for 72 h (higher than in 1 and 2) and then cooled to room temperature at a rate of 10 °C h–1. Blue prism crystals of were obtained in 48% yield based on H4L2. Anal.
