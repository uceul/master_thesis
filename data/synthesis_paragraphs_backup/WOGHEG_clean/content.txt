A mixture of Zn(NO3)2·6H2O (0.279 g, 1 mmol), H2CNC (0.2 g, 1 mmol), and DPT (0.12 g, 0.5 mmol) was suspended in DMF (100 mL) and heated in a vial (400 mL) at 80 °C for 24 h. The red block-shaped crystals formed were collected, washed with DMF, and dried in air (Yield: 60%, based on H2CNC). Elem Anal. Calcd for Zn2(CNC)2(DPT)·(DMF)1.5(H2O) (C36.5H32.5N7.5O10.5Zn2): C, 50.25; H, 3.76; N, 12.05. Found: C, 50.31; H, 3.3; N, 12.18. A sample of MOF 1 was soaked in methanol, filtered, and activated under high vacuum at 75 and 120 °C overnight to get MOF 1a or 1b, respectively.
