Preparation of [Zn(INAIP)]·DMA·H2O (1): A mixture containing Zn(NO3)2·6H2O (30.1 mg, 0.1 mmol) and H2INAIP (28.6 mg, 0.1 mmol) dissolved in DMA (6 mL) was sealed in a 16 mL Teflon lined stainless steel container and heated at 120 °C for 4 days. After the reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature, pale yellow crystals were collected by filtration, washed by DMA, and air‐dried. Yield 48 %, based on ZnII. IR (KBr):  = 3444 (s), 1671 (m), 1618 (s), 1572 (s), 1426 (m), 1366 m), 1287 (w), 1063 (w), 1029 (w), 853 (w), 782 (w), 730 (m), 682 (w), 609 (w) cm–1. C18H19ZnN3O7: calcd. C 47.50, H 4.18, N 9.24 %; found C 47.46, H 4.11, N 9.27 %.
