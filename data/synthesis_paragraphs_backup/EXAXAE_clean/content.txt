A mixture of H2PDC (5 mg, 0.03 mmol), CuI (16 mg, 0.084 mmol), tetrabutylammonium bromide (TATBr, 20 mg, 0.062 mmol), DMF (1 mL), and HNO3 (0.3 mL, 2.5 M in DMF) was sealed into a 20 mL capped vessel. The as-synthesized green block crystals can be obtained after 1 day at 85 °C. The yield is about 79% (based on the ligand).
