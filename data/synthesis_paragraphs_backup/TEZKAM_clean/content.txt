[Zn3(bpdc)3(2,2′‐dmbpy)]⋅(DMF)x(H2O)y was synthesized by the reaction of a mixture of Zn(NO3)⋅6 H2O (0.089 g, 0.3 mmol), 2,2′‐dmbpy (0.019 g, 0.1 mmol), and bpdc (0.072 g, 0.3 mmol) in DMF (10 mL) in a Teflon‐lined autoclave at 85 °C for 4 days. Yellow block‐shaped crystals of 1 were isolated by filtration and washed with DMF.
