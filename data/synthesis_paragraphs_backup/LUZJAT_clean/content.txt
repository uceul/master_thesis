A mixture of Zn(NO3)2·6H2O (0.450 g, 0.1 mmol), (4,4′-bis(pyrid-4-yl)biphenyl) (0.015 g, 0.04 mmol), and H3BTC (0.450 mg, 0.2 mmol) in DMF (4 mL) was placed in a screw-capped vial. Then five drops of HNO3 was added into the mixture. The vial was capped and placed in an oven at 110 °C for 3 days. The resulting colorless single crystals were washed with absolute CH3CH2OH three times to give 1. Anal. calcd for C25H37N3O18Zn3 (863.68), C, 34.77; H, 4.32; N, 4.87. Found C, 34.28; H, 4.15; N, 4.55. IR (KBr, cm−1): 3480(vs); 2940(m); 1632(vs); 1428(v); 1390(v); 1099(m); 938(m); 708(v); 547(m).
