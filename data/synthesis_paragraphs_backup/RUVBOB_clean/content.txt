
A mixture of Cd(NO3)2·4H2O (31 mg, 0.1 mmol), 4-Htba (19 mg, 0.1 mmol), 4,4′-bipyridine (16 mg, 0.1 mmol), DMF (4 mL) and MeOH (1 mL) was placed in a Teflon-lined stainless steel vessel (15 mL) and heated at 120 °C for 3 days and then cooled to room temperature at a rate of 5 °C h−1. Colorless, block crystals were collected by filtration, washed with EtOH and dried in air to afford 8 mg (32% based on 4-Htba) of the product. Anal. calcd. for C18H12CdN6O4: C, 44.23; H, 2.47; N, 17.20. Found: C, 44.20; H, 2.51; N, 17.22.
