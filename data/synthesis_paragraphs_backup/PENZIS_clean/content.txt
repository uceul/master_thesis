(4,4‘-(C5H4N)2(CH2)3)Zn3(HPO3)4, 1. Zinc acetate dihydrate (220 mg, 1.0 mmol), phosphorous acid (164 mg, 2.0 mmol), 4,4‘-(C5H4N)2(CH2)3 (300 mg, 1.5 mmol), and 6 mL of water were added to a heavy-walled glass tube and sealed under vacuum. The tube was placed in an oven for 10 days at 130 °C. The sample contained crystals of 1 and a microcrystalline solid which were collected by filtration. The bulk sample did not give satisfactory results from elemental analysis. A comparison of the calculated powder diffraction pattern and the experimental powder pattern (Supporting Information) show that the most of the material is an unidentified phase. The TGA of a manually separated crystalline sample of 1 shows a 2.2% weight loss by 200 °C, up to 400 °C an additional  6.2% weight loss is observed, and from 430 to 500 °C the sample loses 25% for a total weight loss of 35%. The material is a glassy black solid after being heated to 500 °C. The templating ligand corresponds to 27% of the mass of the sample.
