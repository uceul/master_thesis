A mixture containing bfbpdcH2 (0.03 g, 0.08 mmol), 4,4′-bipyridine (0.012 g, 0.08 mmol), Zn(NO3)2·6H2O (0.094 g, 0.32 mmol), and 4 mL of DMF was placed in a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave. It was heated under autogenous pressure to 100 °C for 72 h and then allowed to cool to room temperature at a rate of 1 °C per min. Colorless block-shaped crystals of 1 were collected by filtration, washed first with DMF followed by acetone, and finally dried in the air. Yield ∼47%. Anal. Calcd. for C62H47F18N4O18Zn4: C, 42.80; H, 2.72; N, 3.22%. Found: C, 42.94; H, 2.79; N, 3.15%. IR (cm–1): 3431 (broad), 2934 (m), 1667 (s), 1624 (s), 1388 (s), 1306 (s).
