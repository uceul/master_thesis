C. [H2N(CH3)2]2Zn3(HPO3)4. A total of 0.3748 g of zinc carbonate, 1.9383 g of water, 1.5193 g of ethylene glycol, 1.0351 g of phosphorous acid, 0.0610 g of hydrogen fluoride−pyridine, and 2.425 g of dimethylamine (40 wt % in water) were mixed and stirred for 45 min in a 23 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave to reach a pH of 8.97. The vessel then was sealed and heated at 120 °C for 5 days. After cooling to room temperature, irregular-shaped clear crystals were obtained as a minor phase. The X-ray powder diffraction pattern showed a predominantly unidentified crystalline phase. Microscopic examination showed the crystals of the major phase to be fibrous and too small for single-crystal analysis.
