[Zn4O(bpz)2(abdc)]⋅guest (1⋅g, MAF‐X11). A mixture of H2abdc (0.068 g, 0.375 mmol), H2bpz (0.143 g, 0.75 mmol), Zn(NO3)2⋅6 H2O (0.446 g, 1.5 mmol), N,N‐dimethylformamide (30 mL), and EtOH (20 mL) was placed in a Teflon‐lined stainless steel vessel (100 mL) and heated at 120 °C for 72 h, and then it was cooled to room temperature at a rate of 0.1 °C min−1. The resulting pale‐yellow block polycrystals (Figure S5) of 1⋅g were isolated by decanting and treated with ethanol and dried under vacuum (yield 203 mg, 45 %). Single crystals for X‐ray single‐crystal diffraction were prepared by heating a solution of H2abdc (0.009 g, 0.025 mmol), H2bpz (0.010 g, 0.05 mmol), and Zn(NO3)2⋅6 H2O (0.030 g, 0.10 mmol) in a mixed solvent of N,N‐dimethylformamide and EtOH (v/v=2/1, 3 mL) in a sealed glass tube (1.0 cm o.d.×10 cm length) at 130 °C for 72 h, and then the mixture was cooled to room temperature at a rate of 0.1 °C min−1 to give pale‐yellow block single crystals (25 mg, yield 84 %). Elemental analysis: Calcd for C29.2H34.6Zn4N9O6.6 ([Zn4O(bpz)2(abdc)]⋅H2O⋅0.6 EtOH): C 39.90, H 3.97, N 14.34. Found: C 39.92, H 3.85, N 14.26 %. IR (KBr): 3464m, 2925m, 1668vs, 1562s, 1495m, 1440s, 1385s, 1257m, 1095m, 1052s, 820w, 770m, 662w, 558w cm−1.
