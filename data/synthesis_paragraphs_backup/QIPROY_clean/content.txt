Synthesis of Cu(H2O)2(L1)(OAc)2 (3): Cu(OAc)2·H2O (0.05 mmol, 10 mg), L1 (0.025 mmol, 11 mg) and oxalic acid (0.1 mmol, 9 mg) in a mixed distilled water (4 mL)–MeCN (4 mL) solvent were placed in a 20 mL vial, and then sealed. The sample was heated at 85 °C for 24 h, and cooled to room temperature. After they were washed with distilled water, blue crystals were obtained. Yield: 14 mg (75% based on L1). Anal. calcd (%) for 3 C29H56CuN4O23 (Mr = 892.32): C, 39.03; H, 6.33; N, 6.28. Found: C, 38.75; H, 6.91; N, 6.40.
