The zinc oxalate, K[C6N2H13][Zn2(C2O4)3]2.4H2O, was synthesized under hydrothermal conditions in the presence of diazabicyclo[2,2,2]octane (DABCO). In a typical synthesis, 0.25 g of ZnO was dispersed in a mixture containing 2 ml n-C4H10OH and 4 ml of water. To this, 0.5 ml of HCl (35%) and 1.132 g of K2C2O4 was added under constant stirring. Finally, 0.26 ml of glacial acetic acid and 0.345 g of DABCO were added and the mixture stirred to homogeneity. The final mixture with a composition of ZnO:2HCl:2K2C2O4:C6N2H12:1.5CH3COOH:200H2O, was sealed in a 23 ml PTFE-lined stainless steel autoclave (Parr, USA) and heated at 150 °C for 72 h. The resulting product, a crop of plate-like transparent crystals, were filtered, washed with deionized water and dried at ambient conditions.
