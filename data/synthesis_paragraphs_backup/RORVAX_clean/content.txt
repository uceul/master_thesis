In a scintillation vial, as-synthesized 1-Zn was washed with fresh DMF (3 × 5 mL) over 3 h and then washed with fresh MeOH (3 × 5 mL) over 3 h. The MeOH was decanted and a solution of Co(NO3)2 (30 mg, mmol) in MeOH (2 mL) was added. The vial was then heated at 60 °C for 18 h. The resulting pale pink crystals were washed with MeOH (3 × 5 mL) over a 3 h period and then left to soak overnight. [1-Zn]·4/5[Co(MeOH)4]·21/2MeOH: C 46.36, H 4.50, N 3.80; Found C 46.07, H 4.28, N 4.13%.
