A mixture of 0.15 g Co(NO3)2·6H2O (0.5 mmol), 0.08 g BDC (0.5 mmol), 0.06 g Ina (0.5 mmol) and DMF (10 mL) was stirred in air, then, adjusted pH to 7.8 with ammonia (25 wt.%). The resulting solution was transferred into a Teflon-lined Parr bomb, heated up to 150 °C for 65 h, cooled down to 100 °C for another 7 h programmatically. Purple hexagonal-plate crystals were obtained (62% yields based on Co). As-prepared catalyst was activated under 150 °C vacuum oven to remove solvents and the unstable formic acid, thus, an active Co site was exposed (Fig. S1). Elemental analysis (%): calc. for C31H17Co3NO19: C, 42.26; H, 1.93; N, 1.6; found (%): C, 42.15; H, 1.95; N, 1.58.
