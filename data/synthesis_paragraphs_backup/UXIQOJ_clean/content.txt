
A mixture of H4bptc (0.016 g, 0.05 mmol), Ni(CH3COO)2·4H2O (0.037 g, 0.15 mmol), LiOH·H2O (0.004 g, 0.1 mmol), HNO3 (100 μL, 1.6 mmol), 2.5 mL DMF and 1.5 mL water was placed into a 25 mL Teflon-lined Parr, heated to 140 °C for 3 days, and then cooled to room temperature for 2 days. Green strip crystals of Ni-MOF were obtained in 46% yield (based on Ni). Elemental analysis (%) found (calcd): C 37.70 (37.86), H 6.06 (5.62), N 4.6 (4.31). IR (KBr, cm−1): 3448 br, 1610 s, 1522 s, 1419 s, 1367 s, 790 m, 725 m, 661 m, 464 m.
