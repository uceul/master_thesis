A mixture of Zn(UO2)(OAc)4·7H2O (40 mg, 0.04 mmol), H4L aqueous solution (118 mg, 0.29 mmol), bipy (10 mg, 0.064 mmol), 18 M HNO3 (2 drops), and deionized water (1.0 mL) was loaded into a 20-mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave. The autoclave was sealed and heated at 180 °C for 2 days and then cooled to room temperature. Yellow crystals were isolated, yield 9 mg (40% based on uranium) initial pH 1.0, final pH 1.4. EDS results on several crystals confirmed the presence of U, Zn, and P. Elemental analysis observed (Calcd): C 20.89% (20.24%); H 2.03% (1.97%); N 3.67% (3.93%).
