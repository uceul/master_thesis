The mixture of NiSO4·6H2O (0.26 g, 1.0 mmol), H3BTC (0.21 g, 1.0 mmol), and L (0.21 g, 1.0 mmol) was dissolved in 8 mL of distilled water. The pH was adjusted to 6.0 by the addition of 1 M NaOH solution. Consequently, the resulting mixture was transferred and sealed in a 25 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel vessel, which was sealed and heated at 180 °C for 3 days, and then, the reaction system was cooled to room temperature. Green crystals were obtained; yield, 0.24 g; 52% (based on Ni). Elemental analysis (%) calcd for 1: C, 47.51; H, 3.84; N, 12.31. Found: C, 47.58; H, 3.78; N, 12.36.
