The compound was synthesized by the solvothermal method. A suspension of Ni(NO3)2·6H2O (0.12 mmol, 35 mg) and L (0.1 mmol, 29 mg) in 10 mL of component solvent (DMF/H2O/C2H5OH = 4/3/3) was sealed in a Teflon-lined autoclave and heated to 140 °C for 4 days. After the autoclave was cooled to room temperature at 10 °C h−1, green block crystals suitable for single-crystal X-ray crystallographic analysis were obtained. The mother liquor was decanted, and the crystals were rinsed three times with ethanol (8 mL × 3) and dried in air for 2 h (yield ca. 30% based on L). Anal. Calcd for C39H35Ni2N9O11: C, 49.74; H, 3.98; N, 13.66. Found: C, 49.36; H, 4.10; N. 13.50.
