Synthesis of MMPF‐3: A mixture of 5,15‐bis(3,5‐dicarboxyphenyl)‐10,20‐bis(2,6‐dibromophenyl)porphyrin (dcdbp) (2.0 mg), Co(NO3)⋅6 H2O (8.0 mg) and 1.2 mL mixed solvent (0.5 mL N,N′‐dimethylformamide (DMF), 0.5 mL ethanol, and 0.2 mL H2O) was sealed in a Pyrex tube under vacuum and heated at 85 °C for 48 h. The resulting dark red crystals were washed with DMF three times to give MMPF‐3 as pure crystals with formula of [Co2(μ2‐H2O)(H2O)4](Co‐dcdbp)⋅(H2O)6⋅(C2H5OH)12⋅(DMF)12 (yield: 70 % based on dcdbp). Elemental Analysis calcd (%) for MMPF‐3: C 44.65, H 6.87, N 7.71; found: C 45.99, H 6.58, N, 7.85. The reaction was amplified to hundreds of milligrams quantity using multiple tubes.
