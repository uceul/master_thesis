To a solution containing Zn(NO3)2·6H2O (133.0 mg, 0.45 mmol), H2hbdc (81.4 mg, 0.45 mmol) and 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (dabco) (16.6 mg, 0.15 mmol) in DMF (3.00 mL) were added, along with a small amount of deionized water (5 μL). The solution mixture was stirred at room temperature for 1 h, and then heated to 85 °C for 16 h in a sealed glass vial. After filtering off a small amount of polycrystalline residue, the solution was allowed to stand at room temperature in a capped vial to produce truncated octahedron-shaped single crystals. The product was collected after 5–7 days and soaked in dichloromethane before drying under vacuum overnight (51.0 mg, 40%). Calcd: C, 43.67; H, 3.89; N, 4.77; Zn, 18.57. Found: C, 43.53; H, 3.65; N, 4.91; Zn, 18.99%.
