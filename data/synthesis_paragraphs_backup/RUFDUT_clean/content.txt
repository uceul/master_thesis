A mixture of Ni(Ac)2·4H2O (0.12 g, 0.50 mmol), H4L (0.15 g, 0.50 mmol), N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) (4 mL) and H2O (4 mL) was stirred for dissolution about 1 h at room temperature, and then heated at 140 °C for 72 h in a 20 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave under autogenous pressure. After the mixture was cooled slowly to room temperature, the green plate crystals were obtained. Yield 33.8% (based on Ni).
