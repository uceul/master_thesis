
A mixture of Ce(NO3)2·6H2O (0.15 mmol) and 2,5-di(3′,5′-dicarboxylphenyl)benzene (0.005 mmol) was dissolved in DMF (2 mL) in a screw-capped vial. Then, three drops of HNO3 (65%, aq) were added to the mixture. The vial was capped and placed in an oven at 105 °C for 72 h. Crystals were obtained and air-dried (yield 25%, based on Ce). IR (KBr): 3126 (m), 2358 (m), 1650 (v), 1524 (m), 1386 (v), 1353 (s), 1192 (w), 1092 (w), 935 (w), 773 (s), 660 (m) cm−1. Elemental analysis (%) calcd for 1, {[Ce(L1)0.5(NO3)(H2O)2]·2DMF}: C, 34.87; H, 3.96; N, 7.18; found: C, 34.62; H, 3.85; N, 7.06.
