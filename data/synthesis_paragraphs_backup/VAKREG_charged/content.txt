
A mixture of Co(NO3)2·6H2O (0.101 g, 0.5 mmol), 1,4-bdcH2 (0.083 g, 0.5 mmol) and DMF (10 mL) was stirred for 30 min in air at room temperature. The mixture was transferred and sealed in a Teflon reactor (15 mL) and heated at 160 °C for three days. After the mixture had been cooled to room temperature at 10 °C h−1, purple hexagonal-plate crystals of 1 were obtained (75% yield based on Co). Elemental analysis (%): calc. for C48H60Co3N6O20: C, 47.34; H, 4.97; N, 6.90; found: C, 47.19; H, 4.78; N, 6.61. IR data (cm−1): 3432(s), 2675(m), 1576(s), 1385(s), 1025(w), 893(w), 821(w), 746(m), 551(w).
