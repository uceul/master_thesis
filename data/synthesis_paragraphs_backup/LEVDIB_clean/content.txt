
A mixture of the organic linker H4L (10.0 mg, 13.5 μmol) and Cu(NO3)2·2.5H2O (20.0 mg, 86.0 μmol, Aldrich) was dissolved into a mixed solvent (DMF–C2H5OH–H2O, 1.5/0.5/0.2 mL) in a screw-capped vial (20 mL). 40 μL of 6 M HCl were then added. The vial was capped and heated at 363 K for 48 h. Greenish rhombic crystals were obtained in 45% yield. UTSA-40 can be best formulated as [Cu2L(H2O)2]·6DMF·2H2O on the basis of single-crystal X-ray structure determination, TGA and microanalysis. Selected FTIR (neat, cm−1): 1654, 1624, 1580, 1492, 1418, 1367, 1338, 1244, 1205, 1143, 1088, 1056, 1014, 915, 871, 817, 776, 729, 717, 659; TGA data for loss of 6DMF and 4H2O: calcd: 37.2%, found: 37.6%; anal. for C58H74Cl2Cu2N6O20: calcd: C 50.73, H 5.43, N 6.12, found: C 50.43, H 5.66, N 6.08%.
