A sample of (C5H5NH)2[Ga4F2(O3PC2H4PO3)3] (II) was synthesized in a similar manner to compound I. Initially Ga2(SO4)3·18H2O (0.768 mmol) was dissolved in a solution of distilled water (111 mmol), pyridine (32.9 mmol) and HF (4.32 mmol), followed by the addition of ethylenediphosphonic acid (3.25 mmol) and tris(2-aminoethyl)amine (8.70 mmol) to the subsequent mixture. The resultant mixture contained Ga2(SO4)3, ethylenediphosphonic acid, HF, tris(2-aminoethyl)amine, pyridine and water in the molar ratio: 1:4.24:5.62:11.3:42.8:170 and, after stirring, had a pH of 11.16. This reagent mixture was loaded in a 23 ml Teflon-lined steel autoclave and heated for 12 days at 150 °C and slowly cooled in air to room temperature. The resultant solid product was washed with de-ionized water, separated by suction filtration and consisted of colorless, plate-like single crystals. The powder X-ray diffraction pattern of this product is provided in the Supporting Information and was judged to be monophasic from the excellent agreement between the experimental powder X-ray diffraction pattern and that calculated using the Le Bail profile analysis [20] starting with the unit cell parameters obtained from the single-crystal analysis of compound II. Microprobe analysis on crystals of compound II indicated a Ga:P ratio of 1:1.5 and that fluorine was present in the crystals.
