Synthesis of 1: a mixture of ZnO (1 mmol, 0.082 g), H3PO3 (4 mmol, 0.328 g), sec-butylammine (5 mmol, 0.505 ml), H2O (5 mL) and ethyleneglycol (5 mL) was heated at 160 °C in a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave for three days. When the autoclave was cooled to room temperature, colorless plate crystals were obtained in about 60.75% yield based on ZnO. Synthesis of 2: a mixture of ZnO (1 mmol, 0.082 g), H3PO3 (4 mmol, 0.328 g), 2-hydroxypropylammine (5 mmol, 0.388 ml), H2O (2 mL) and ethyleneglycol (2 mL) was heated at 160 °C in a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave for two days. When the autoclave was cooled to room temperature, colorless block crystals were obtained in about 44.89% yield based on ZnO.
