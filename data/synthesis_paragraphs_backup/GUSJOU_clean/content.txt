Synthesis of [Mn2{(OOCC2H4Ge)4S6}(MeOH)(dmf)2] (1): H4PAGeS (0.01 g, 0.013 mmol) and MnCl2⋅4 H2O (0.004 g, 0.0195 mmol) were placed in a pyrex glass tube (10 mm diameter and 200 mm length) in a solvent mixture of DMF/methanol (0.3/0.2 mL). The tube was sealed under vacuum and heated at a constant rate of 1 °C min−1 to 100 °C for 24 h, then cooled at a constant rate of 0.5 °C min−1 to room temperature. The colorless crystals of 1 were washed with methanol repeatedly (5×2 mL). Yield: 0.006 g (0.0056 mmol, 43 %); FT‐IR (KBr, Nujol mull in polyethylene windows): =3418.1 (br, methanol OH), 2921.7 (w), 1655.5 (s, DMF CO), 1565.7 (s, COO asymmetric stretch), 1400.3 (s, COO symmetric stretch), 1299.8 (m, CN), 1255.3 (w), 1168.0 (w), 1106.4 (m), 778.9 (m), 709.0 (w), 424.4 (s, GeS), 381.0 (w), 315.0 (w), 195.4 (w), 153.2 cm−1 (w); UV/Vis (suspension of single crystals in nujol oil): λmax (ε)=307(4.04), 223 nm (5.57 eV); elemental analysis calcd (%): C 21.40, H 3.33, N 2.62, S 17.96; found: C 21.36, H 3.30, N 2.62, S 18.00.
