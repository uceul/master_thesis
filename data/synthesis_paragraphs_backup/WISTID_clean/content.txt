A mixture of Zn(NO3)2·6H2O (0.059 g, 0.2 mmol) and H4bptc (0.033 g, 0.1 mmol) in water–ethanol (2:1 v/v) was stirred for 30 min, and then sealed in a 25 mL Teflon reactor and heated at 150 °C for 72 h. After the sample was gradually cooled to room temperature at a rate of 10 °C h−1, colorless block crystals were obtained. Yield: 65% based on Zn(II) salt. Anal. calcd for C18H16O11Zn2 (%): C, 40.10; H, 2.99. Found: C, 40.83; H, 2.57. IR (KBr, cm−1): 3745 (m), 3436 (m), 1622 (s), 1562 (m), 1429 (w), 1380 (m), 977 (s), 921 (s), 771 (s), 543 (m).
