(c) [Cu2(μ3-trz)(μ3-Cl)2] (3). A mixture of CuCl2·2H2O (0.34 g, 1.0 mmol) and 1,2,4-triazole (0.069 g, 2.0 mmol) in 10 mL of H2O was introduced into a Parr Teflon-lined stainless steel vessel (25 cm3), after which the vessel was sealed and heated at 180 °C for 5 days under autogenous pressure. The mixture was cooled to room temperature at a rate of 0.5 °C min-1. Black prismatic crystals of 3 were collected, washed with H2O, and air-dried (low yield:  25% based on Cu). Anal. Calcd for C2H2Cu2N3Cl2:  C, 9.03; H, 0.758; N, 15.79. Found:  C, 9.10; H, 0.79; N, 15.72.
