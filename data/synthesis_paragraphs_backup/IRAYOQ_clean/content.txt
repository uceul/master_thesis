V2O5 (0.09 g, 0.5 mmol) was added to deionized water (10 mL), resulting in a yellow turbid mixture. H3PO4 (1 mL) and ethanediamine (1.5 mL) were added to the mixture and it turned a light green color. The pH value was 3. The mixture was placed in a Teflon-lined stainless reactor and heated at 170 °C for 72 h. Blue crystals of 2 were obtained (0.08 g, 23.2%). Anal. Calc. for C4H24N4O46P8V9: C, 3.06; H, 1.54; N, 3.57; V, 29.19. Found: C, 3.05; H, 1.56; N, 3.58; V, 28.21%. IR (KBr/pellets) νmax/cm−1: 3585 (N–H); 3373 (O–H); 1620, 1534 (VO); 1009 (P–O); 633–246 (V–O).
