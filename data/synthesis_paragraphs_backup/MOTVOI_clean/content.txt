
A mixture of H2MHFDA (0.1 mmol, 28.4 mg), Eu(NO3)3·6H2O (0.1 mmol, 44.7 mg), DMF (5 mL), EtOH (2 mL), MeCN (1 mL) and H2O (1 mL) was sealed in a 25 mL Teflon-lined bomb and heated at 80 °C for 3 days. The reaction mixture was slowly cooled to room temperature. Yellowish diamond-like crystals of 1 suitable for X-ray diffraction analysis were isolated in 74% yield.
