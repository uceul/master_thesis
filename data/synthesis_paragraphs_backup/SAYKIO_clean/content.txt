To a 20-mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave was added 0.1 M UO2(NO3)3 aqueous solution (1.0 mL, 0.10 mmol), H6L2 (60 mg, 0.062 mmol), and deionized water (5 mL, 278 mmol). The mixture was heated at 180 Â°C for 7 days and then cooled to room temperature. Yellow platelets of the title compound suitable for single-crystal X-ray diffraction studies were isolated: initial pH 3.0; final pH 2.3. Yield: 102 mg (56% based on uranium). Energy-dispersive X-ray analysis of several crystals showed the presence of uranium. Elem anal. Obsd (calcd): C, 34.65 (34.49); H, 2.31 (2.23).
