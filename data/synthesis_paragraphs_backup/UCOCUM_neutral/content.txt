To 10 mL of distilled water was added Cu(NO3)2·2.5H2O (480 mg, 2.50 mmol) and K5CuPW11O39 (400 mg, 0.14 mmol), and the resulting blue solution was stirred for 10 min. Trimesic acid (420 mg, 2.0 mmol) and then (CH3)4NOH (362 mg, 2.0 mmol) were added sequentially, with 10 min of stirring after each addition. The resulting solution with pH ∼ 3 was transferred to a Teflon-lined Parr bomb, heated up to 200 °C for 16 h, programmatically cooled down to 100 °C for another 4 h, and left to cool to ambient temperature. The resulting polyhedron-like deep-blue crystals were separated from the solution and washed with distilled water several times. Further purification was carried out by soaking the crystals in saturated KCl solution and distilled water and sonicating them at least 3 times for 30 min each time to exchange and remove any free metal ions. The product was dried in vacuo overnight to remove water molecules trapped in the pores of the product. Yield: 200 mg (ca. 25% based on POM).
