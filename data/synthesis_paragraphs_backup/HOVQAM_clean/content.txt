A mixture of HL (0.021 g, 0.10 mmol), Co(ClO4)2·6H2O (0.036 g, 0.10 mmol), NaOH (0.004 g, 0.10 mmol), and H2O (10 mL) was kept in a 15 mL Teflon liner autoclave at 80 °C for 3 days. After the mixture was cooled to the room temperature, pink block crystals of complex 2 were collected with a yield of 33%. Anal. Calc. for C36H38N12O12Cl2Co (2): C, 45.01; H, 3.99; N, 17.50. Found: C, 45.08; H, 4.05; N, 17.48%. IR (KBr pellet, cm−1): 3362 (m), 3132 (ms), 1627 (ms), 1524 (s), 1449 (m), 1358 (m), 1312 (s), 1262 (s), 1162 (m), 1130 (s), 1074 (s), 962 (ms), 946 (ms), 826 (s), 752 (s), 646 (s). Caution: Perchlorate metal salts as explosive items should be used carefully under hydrothermal condition.
