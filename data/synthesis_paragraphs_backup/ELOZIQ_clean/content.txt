Isophthalic acid (H2ipa, 166 mg, 1 mmol), adenine (Had, 135 mg, 1 mmol), Cd(NO3)2·4H2O (462 mg, 1 mmol) and tetraethylammonium bromide (220 mg, 1 mmol) were added to 4 mL DMA (=N,N-dimethylacetamide) and 1.5 mL MeOH (=methanol) mixed solvents, and then the solution was placed in a 20 mL vial and stired at room temperature for 1 h. The mixture was heated at 100 °C for 3 days, and then cooled slowly to room temperature over 4 h. Colourless rod-like crystals of the product were formed and collected by filtration and washed with DMA several times. (Yield: 65% based on H2ipa).
