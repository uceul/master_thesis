H2(PIP)[VIVO(H2O)VIII(OH)(O3PCH2CO2)2]·2.5H2O (2). A solution of VOSO4 (0.97 g, 0.6 mmol), triethyl phosphonoacetate (0.124 g, 0.54 mmol), piperazine (PIP) (0.115 g, 0.6 mmol), and H2O (7 mL) in the molar ratio of 1:0.9:1:650 was stirred, to which was added two drops of hydrofluoric acid (35%) to pH ≈ 5. The resulting solution was transferred into 15 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel reactor, which was heated at 170 °C for 200 h. After cooling of the sample to room temperature, dark green crystals of 2 (40%) were recovered. The measured pH value of the solution after reaction is 2. Anal.
