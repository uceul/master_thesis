
A mixture of Zn(OAc)2·2H2O (0.0219 g, 0.1 mmol), KH2TDA (0.0157 g, 0.08 mmol) and bpy (0.0312 g, 0.2 mmol) was dissolved in H2O (6 mL). The mixture was sealed in a 25 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel reactor, heated at 180 °C for 72 h and then cooled to room temperature at the speed of 2.1 °C h−1. Colourless block crystals of 1 in ca. 45% yield (based on Zn) were collected by washing with distilled water and dried in air. Anal. calcd. for C48H43N14O13.5Zn3 (%): C 46.94, H 3.53, N 15.97. Found (%): C 47.36, H 2.67, N, 15.13. IR (KBr, cm−1): 3390 (s), 1637 (vs), 1618 (vs), 1395 (s), 1274 (m), 1213 (w), 1002 (w), 820 (m), 706 (w).
