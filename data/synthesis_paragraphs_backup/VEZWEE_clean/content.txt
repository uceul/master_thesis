
[H2bcpb]Br2 (0.046 g, 0.10 mmol) and NaN3 (0.039 g, 0.60 mmol) were dissolved in water (2 mL), then a methanol solution (4 mL) of Mn(ClO4)2·6H2O (0.15 g, 0.40 mmol) was added under stirring. The mixture was sealed in a 23 mL Teflon-lined autoclave, heated at 80 °C for 3 days. After cooling down to room temperature slowly, yellow rod-shaped crystals of 2 were collected. Yield: 20% based on [H2bcpb]Br2. Elem. anal. calcd (%) for C65H82Cl7Mn4 N11O52: C, 33.7; H, 3.57; N, 6.65. Found: C, 33.3; H, 3.54; N, 6.64. Main IR bands (KBr, cm−1): 3466m, 2111s [ν(N3−)], 1653s, 1622s [νas(COO)], 1609s, 1570s, 1463w, 1402s [νs(COO)], 1285w, 1216w, 1181w, 1100s [ν(ClO4−)], 878w.
