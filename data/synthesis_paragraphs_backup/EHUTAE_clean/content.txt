H4LV (50 mg, 0.078 mmol) and Cu(NO3)2·2.5H2O (145 mg, 0.622 mmol) were dissolved in a mixture of DMF (7.0 mL) and H2O (1.0 mL) in a pressure tube (15 mL). Upon addition of 6 M HCl (20 μL), the tube was capped and heated in an oil bath at 85 °C for 48 h to afford blue crystals. The reaction mixture was allowed to cool to room temperature, and the crystals were washed with warm DMF and dried in air. Yield: 60.9 mg, 85% based on H4LV.
