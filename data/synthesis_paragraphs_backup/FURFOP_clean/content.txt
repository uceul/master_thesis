A mixture of Zn(NO3)2·6H2O (0.152 g, 0.5 mmol), H2tdc(0.085 g, 0.5 mmol), bib (0.095 g, 0.5 mmol) and DMA (3 mL) was sealed in a 23 mL Teflon–lined stainless steel reactor under autogenous pressure at 120 °C for 72 h and then cooled to room temperature slowly. Colorless block crystals of 2 were obtained in 54% yield based on Zn(NO3)2·6H2O. Elemental analyses for C40H50N10O10S2Zn2 (1025.80): Calcd. (%) C, 46.79; H, 4.87; N, 13.65.
