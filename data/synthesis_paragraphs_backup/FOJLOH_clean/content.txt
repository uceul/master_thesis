Synthesis of [Zn(HL)(H2O)]n (1): A mixture of H3L (0.057 g 0.10 mmol), Zn(NO3)2·6H2O (0.060 g 0.20 mmol), DMF (4.0 g), and distilled H2O (1.0 g) was placed in a 20 mL glass vial and stirred for half an hour. The mixture was transferred to a 15 mL Teflon vial. The Teflon vial was placed inside a stainless steel autoclave and heated at 115 °C for 5 d. Microcrystalline solid was obtained upon cooling the reaction mixture to room temperature at the ambient conditions. The mixture was filtered and the filterate was kept at room temperature to obtained needle like colorless crystals of 1 after a month. Yield; 0.04 g (61 % based on H3L used). Mp; > 250 °C. C33H30ZnO10: C 60.8; H 4.6 %; found: C 57.2; H 4.6 %.25 FT‐IR (KBr):  = 3433, 2925, 1604, 1385, 1223 cm–1.
