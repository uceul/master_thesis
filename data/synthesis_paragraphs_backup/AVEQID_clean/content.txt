
A mixture of Zn(NO3)2·6H2O (15 mg, 0.05 mmol), H8TBCB (5 mg, 0.006 mmol), DMAc (3.5 mL), H2O (1 mL) and two drops of aqueous HNO3 solution (2.0 M) was sealed in a 20 mL capped vessel. The as-synthesized brown crystals can be obtained at 85 °C for 3 days in an oven. The yield is about 62% (based on the ligand). Element analysis (%) calc. for C64H77O27N7Zn4: C, 46.97; H, 4.71; N, 5.99; found: C, 46.75; H, 4.79; N, 6.07. Selected FT-IR data (KBr pellet, cm−1): 2935 (br), 1619 (s), 1412 (s), 1356 (s), 1261 (s), 1186 (s), 1020 (s), 783 (s), 717 (s), 660 (s), 592 (s), 463 (s) (Fig. S1).
