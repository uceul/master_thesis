
In a typical synthesis procedure, a mixture of 1,4-benzenedicarboxylic acid (H2BDC) (0.1 g, 0.60 mmol), 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (DABCO) (0.075 g, 0.67 mmol), and Co(NO3)2·6H2O (0.1 g, 0.34 mmol) was dissolved in a solvent mixture of N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) (20 mL), CH3COOH (2 mL, 0.01 mmol), and HCl (20 μl, 0.24 μmol). The resulting solution was then dispensed equally to ten different 10 mL vials. The vials were heated at 120 °C in an isothermal oven for 12 h. After cooling the vials to room temperature, the solid product was removed by decanting the mother liquor and then washed with DMF (3 × 10 mL) to remove any unreacted species. The DMF solvent was exchanged with dichloromethane (DCM) (3 × 10 mL) at room temperature. The product was then dried at 120 °C for 4 h under vacuum, yielding green needle-shaped crystals of VNU-10 (76% based on Co(NO3)2·6H2O).
