A mixture of bpydbH2 (0.040 g, 0.1 mmol), Zn(NO3)2·6H2O (0.060 g, 0.2 mmol), HATZ (0.017 g, 0.2 mmol), DMA (2 mL), NMF (2 mL), and HBF4 (0.5 mL, 37% aq) was sealed into a vial (5 mL) and heated at 120 °C for 3 days. Yellow block crystals of 1 were harvested after the vial was slowly cooled to room temperature in 60% yield (based on bpydbH2). Anal. Calcd (%) for 1 (C59H57N13O11Zn2): C, 56.47; H, 4.58; N, 14.51. Found: C, 56.93; H, 4.77; N, 14.32.
