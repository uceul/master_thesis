The solid of Cd(NO3)2·4H2O (0.060 g, 0.19 mmol) was solved in the solution of H4BTC (0.024 g, 0.095 mmol) in 4 mL of DMF and 1 mL of H2O, to which two drops of 6 mol/L HCl were added. The mixture was sealed in a vial and heated to 100 °C in a drying oven for 72 h, then cooled to room temperature. The colorless block crystals (0.036 g) of 1 were collected by filtration and dried in the air after washing with DMF and CH2Cl2 three times, respectively. Yield 79.98% (based on H4BTC). Anal. Calcd for C24H24O18Cd3N2 (Mr = 947.64): C, 30.24; H, 2.34; N, 2.96%. Found: C, 30.20; H, 2.54; N, 2.63%.
