A solution of Zn(Ac)2·2H2O (0.113 g, 0.516 mmol) in 2.5 mL water was carefully layered onto a solution of H3pbc (0.096 g, 0.485 mmol) and triethylene tetramine (0.139 g, 0.950 mmol) in 1,3-butanediol (5.0 mL) in a Telflon-lined stainless steel autoclave (33 mL). The resulting mixture was then heated at 170 °C for 48 h. The final product was obtained as transparent column crystals with the size of 0.18 × 0.15 × 0.10 mm3. The crystals were filtered, washed with distilled water, and dried at ambient temperature. The yield was about 44.6% (0.075 g) based on H3pbc.
