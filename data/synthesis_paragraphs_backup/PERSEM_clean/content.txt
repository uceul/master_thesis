The mixture of UO2(NO3)2·6H2O (250 mg, 0.5 mmol), metallic zinc (40 mg, 0.62 mmol), mellitic acid (220 mg, 0.64 mmol), and H2O (5 mL, 277 mmol) was placed in a Parr bomb and then heated statically at 150 °C for 24 h. The pH of the solution was 0.6 before the reaction and 1.1 at the end of the reaction, which results in the formation of a pure phase (see XRD powder pattern, Supporting Information, Figure S2). The resulting yellow product was filtered off, washed with water, and dried at room temperature. The title compound was examined by scanning electron microscope (Hitachi S‐3400N) and had large crystals of 100–200 μm in size (Supporting Information, Figure S1).
