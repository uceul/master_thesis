The synthesis of the compound [Co3(C8H4O4)4]2−[C4H12N]+2·3C5H11NO (1) is a one-pot solvothermal reaction. A mixture of CoCl2·6H2O (0.294 g, 1 mmol) and DEF (2 mL) was added to a mixture of 1,4-benzenedicarboxylic acid (H2BDC, 0.166 g, 1 mmol) and DEF (8 mL). This mixture was sealed in a 12 mL Teflon autoclave at 375 K for 72 h, which resulted in small, rhombic-shaped purple crystals.
