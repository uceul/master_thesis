
A mixture of Zn(NO3)2·6H2O (0.075 mmol, 0.022 g), H22BPC (0.075 mmol, 0.018 g), L (0.05 mmol, 0.016 g) and DMF (8 mL) was heated at 120 °C in a Teflon-lined autoclave for 3 days, followed by slow cooling to room temperature. The resulting colorless prismatic crystals were filtered off (yield: ca. 58% based on Zn). Elemental Anal. Found: C, 57.54; H, 4.49; N, 8.56%. Calcd for C165H153N21O39Zn6: C, 57.50; H, 4.47; N, 8.53%.
