[Yb2(NDC)3(H2O)]·H2O (3): Two drops of hydrochloric acid (1.65 mol·L−1) were added to a mixture of dipotassium 2,6‐naphthalenedicarboxylate (0.044 g, 0.15 mmol) and H2O (15 mL) and the mixture was stirred. YbCl3·6H2O (0.039 g, 0.1 mmol) was then added. The mixture was sealed in a 50 mL stainless steel reactor with Teflon liner and heated at 180 °C for 72 h. Light‐yellow crystals of 3 were obtained in 29.3% yield (0.015 g). C36H22O14Yb2 (1024.6): calcd. C 42.20, H 2.16; found C 42.08, H 2.31. IR data (KBr pellet):  = 3447 m, 2977 m, 1693 s, 1602 s, 1574 s, 1423 s, 1293 s, 1193 m, 775 m, 452 m cm−1.
