Compound 1 was prepared from a starting mixture containing indium chloride tetrahydrate (InCl3·4H2O) (Aladdin, 98%), phosphorous acid (H3PO3) (Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Beijing Co., Ltd, 99%), oxalic acid (H2C2O4) (Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Beijing Co., Ltd, 99%), piperazine (Aladdin, 99%) and water (H2O) under mild hydrothermal conditions and autogenous pressure. Typically, 0.10 g InCl3 and 0.45 g H3PO3 were mixtured in 6 ml water, which was followed by addition of 0.45 g piperazine and 0.4 g H2C2O4 at stirring. The mixture was further stirred for 30 min at room temperature and heated at 130 °C for 3 days. After slow cooling to the room temperature, the resulting colorless crystals of 1 was recovered by filtration, washed with distilled water and dried in the air. The yield of product was 56% in weight based on indium.
