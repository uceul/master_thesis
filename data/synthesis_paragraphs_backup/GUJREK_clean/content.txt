The ∞3[Cu2ICu2II{H2O}2{(Me–trz–mba)2thio}2]Cl2 MOF samples were synthesized using solvothermal synthesis with H2O/MeCN (water/acetonitrile, volume ratio 1:1) as a solvent. A Teflon beaker was loaded with 0.1 mmol (1.0 equiv) of the protonated ligand H2(Me–trz–mba)2thio, 0.4 mmol (4.0 equiv) CuCl2·2H2O and 5 mL of a mixture of water/acetonitrile (v/v = 1:1). The vessel was sealed and the reaction mixture was heated up to 140 °C within 1 h. The temperature was kept on a constant level for 5 h, and then the autoclave was cooled to room temperature during a period of 59 h. After filtration, the crystalline product was washed with H2O/MeCN to get the target compound in 72% yield. In order to achieve a complete solvent exchange, selected samples were Soxhlet extracted with methanol for 7 days. After each day, a new batch of methanol was used.
