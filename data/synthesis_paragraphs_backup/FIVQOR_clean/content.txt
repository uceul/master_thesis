The title compound MIL-90 or Ga5(PO4)4(C2O4)F2(OH)2·1.5N2C3H12 was prepared by hydrothermal method under autogenous pressure. The reactants were gallium oxide (Ga2O3, Aldrich, 99.99%+), phosphoric acid (85% H3PO4, Prolabo, RP Normapur), hydrofluoric acid (40% HF, Prolabo RP Normapur), oxalic acid (HO2C−CO2H·2H2O, Alfa, noted ox) and 1,3-diaminopropane (H2N−(CH2)3−NH2, Aldrich, 99%+, noted dap). HF is a hazardous acid which must be handled with care. The starting mixture, corresponding to the molar composition 1 Ga2O3 (650 mg), 2 H3PO4 (0.47 mL), 2 HF (0.29 mL), 2 ox (874.5 mg), 0.8 dap (0.24 mL), and 80 H2O (5 mL), was placed in a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave, heated at 180 °C for 24 h, and then cooled to room temperature for 12 h. The pH of the synthesis medium was 1 at the end of the hydrothermal treatment. The obtained white crystalline product was collected by filtration, washed with distilled water, and dried at room temperature. The powder X-ray diffraction pattern indicated that the product was a new compound.
