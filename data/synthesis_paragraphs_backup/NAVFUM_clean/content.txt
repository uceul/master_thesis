Synthesis and Initial Characterization. The iron oxalatophosphite, [C4N2H12][FeII4(HPO3)2(C2O4)3], I, was synthesized under  hydrothermal conditions using iron(II) oxalate dihydrate as the source of iron. In a typical synthesis, 0.279 g of iron(II) oxalate dihydrate was dissolved in 7 mL of deionized water. To this, 0.318 g of H3PO3 was added. Finally, 0.334 g of piperazine (PIP) was added to the mixture and homogenized for 30 min at room temperature. The final mixture with the composition, 1.0 FeC2O4·2H2O:2.0 H3PO3:2.0 (PIP):200 H2O, was transferred in to a 23-mL acid-digestion bomb and heated at 150 °C for 72 h. The resulting product contained only light-yellow-color cubelike single crystals in large quantities. The crystals were filtered, washed with deionized water, and dried at ambient conditions. The yield of the product was ∼80% based on Fe. The initial and final pH of the reaction mixture was ∼4.
