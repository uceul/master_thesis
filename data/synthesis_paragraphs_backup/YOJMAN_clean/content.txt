
A mixture of K6[α-P2W18O62]·15H2O (0.496 g, 0.1 mmol), 1,2,4-triazole (0.114 g, 1.6 mmol) and CoCl2·6H2O (0.147 g, 0.6 mmol) was dissolved in 8.0 mL of distilled water. The pH value of the mixture was carefully adjusted with 2 M NaOH solution to approximately 4.50 and then sealed into a 15 mL Teflon-lined autoclave, heated at 180 °C for 3 days and then cooled down to room temperature at a rate of 10 °C h−1. Pink crystals of 5 were collected and washed with distilled water and dried in air to give the product (yield: 35% based on Co). Elemental analysis calcd. (%) for C28H118N42O169P4Na2K2Co11W36: C 2.99, H 1.06, N 5.22, Na 0.41, P 1.10, K 0.69, Co 5.76, W 58.77; found: C 2.56, H 1.49, N 5.65, Na 0.83, P 0.85, K 1.02, Co 6.12, W 59.15.
