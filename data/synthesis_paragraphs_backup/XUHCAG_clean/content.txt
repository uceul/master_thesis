Synthesis of 1: The mixture of Ni(Ac)2·4H2O (0.5 mmol), H4dpstc (0.25 mmol), bim (0.5 mmol), NH4F (0.5 mmol), Et3N (0.35 mL) and distilled water (9 mL) was stirred at room temperature for 15 min, then transferred and sealed in an 18 mL Teflon-lined autoclave, which was heated at 150 °C for 72 hours under autogenous pressure. After slow cooling to room temperature, green block crystals of 1 were obtained, washed with distilled water several times, and dried at ambient temperature (yield: 51% based on Ni). Elemental analysis (%) calcd for C36H40N8Ni2O13S: C 45.89, H 4.28, N 11.89, Ni 12.46; found: C 45.51, H 4.38, N 12.05, Ni 12.71%.
