Synthesis of [H2N(CH3)2]2[Cd2(L)2(SO4)]∙DMF (1): A mixture of H2cpds (15.0 mg, 0.05 mmol), CdSO4 (21.0 mg, 0.1 mmol) and DMF (10 mL) was sealed in a Teflon-linear autoclave (23 mL), heated at 120 °C in an oven for 3 days, and then cooled to room temperature at a rate of 5 °C h− 1. Colorless block crystals suitable for X-ray diffraction were obtained by filtration. Yield: ca. 30%. Analysis calculated for C19H29O9N5S3Cd2: C 28.80, H 3.69%, N 8.84;%; found: C 28.89, H 3.62%, N 8.76;%. IR (KBr pellet, cm− 1): 3438 (m), 3055 (m), 2798 (m), 2462 (w), 1674 (m), 1592 (s) 1530 (w), 1467 (w), 1395 (vs), 1347 (m), 1257 (w), 1129 (m), 1102 (m), 1024 (w), 858 (w),782 (w), 748 (w), 661 (w), 620 (w), 547 (w).
