A mixture of H4L2 (12 mg, 0.025 mmol), KOH (5 mg, 0.1 mmol), Zn(NO3)2·6H2O (12 mg, 0.05mmol), and H2O (7 mL) was sealed in a 15-mL PTFE-lined stainless-steel acid digestion bomb and heated at 160 °C for 6 days and then was cooled to give large quantities of white crystals of 4, which were obtained by filtration and washed with water. The sample was allowed to air-dry. Yield: 12.22 mg (80%) yield based on metal. Anal. Calcd for C24H16O11Zn2: C, 47.17%; H, 2.64%. Found: C, 47.26%; H, 2.72%.
