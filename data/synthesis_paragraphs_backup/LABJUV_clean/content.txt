
A mixture of CuI (95 mg), Cu(BF4)2·xH2O (122 mg), bztpy (6 mg) and MeCN (10 ml) in a 23 mL Teflon reactor was heated at 175 °C for three days and then cooled to room temperature at a rate of 5 K h−1. Dark red block crystals were obtained in 45–50% yield (based on bztpy) after washing with MeCN and drying in air. Anal. calcd for C52H40Cu10I10N8O2: C 23.02, H 1.49, N 4.13. Found: C 23.07, H 1.53, N 4.09.
