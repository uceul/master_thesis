
[Cd1.5(m-BDC)2(PR63)0.5(H2O)2]·7H2O: A mixture of [PR63]2+·2[NO3]− (82 mg, 0.05 mmol), Cd(NO3)2·4H2O (61.6 mg, 0.2 mmol), m-H2BDC (33 mg, 0.2 mmol), and triethylamine (3 drops) in 3.5 ml of water was kept at 140 °C for 48 h in a Teflon-lined stainless steel container and cooled to room temperature. Polyhedral light yellow crystals were collected and dried in air (yield: 35% based on [PR63]2+·2[NO3]−). When CdSO4·8H2O was used, a higher production of compound 4 could be obtained. Elemental analysis calc. For C86H122N28O49Cd3 (%): C, 38.70; N, 14.69; H, 4.61; Cd, 12.63; found (%): C, 38.58; N, 14.26; H, 4.36; Cd, 12.75. IR (cm−1, major absorbances): 3434 (w), 1738 (s), 1604 (s), 1472 (s), 1379 (w), 964 (s), 800 cm−1 (s).
