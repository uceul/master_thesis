In a 20 mL glass vial equipped with a magnetic stirrer bar, calcium carbonate (150 mg, 1.50 mmol) was added to a vigorously stirred suspension of H2dhbq (210 mg, 1.50 mmol) in water (10 mL). The vial was capped, and the mixture was stirred overnight at room temperature. After this time, a crimson suspension was obtained, which was filtered off and washed with water (3 × 20 mL) followed by dichloromethane (3 × 20 mL). The resulting powder was dried in vacuo at 80 °C for a period of 12 h to afford 1·H2O as a dark red powder (275 mg, 69%). Anal. Calcd for C6H6O6Ca·0.1H2O: C, 33.36; H, 2.89. Found: C, 33.22; H, 2.74. IR (neat): 3270 (m br), 1668 (w), 1641 (w), 1594 (w), 1502 (s), 1387 (s), 1259 (s), 825 (m) cm–1. Single crystals of the compound could be prepared by heating the same aqueous reaction mixture to 60 °C under static conditions for a period of 3 days.
