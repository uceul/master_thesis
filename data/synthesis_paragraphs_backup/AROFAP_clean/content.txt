A mixture of H4X (0.05 mmol, 30.8 mg) and Cd(NO3)2·6H2O (0.11 mmol, 28.2 mg) was dissolved in 6 mL of DMF/H2O (2:1) in a 20 mL vial. The reaction vial was capped tightly and placed in an oven at 85 °C for 24 h. The mixture was then gradually cooled to room temperature at a rate of 10 °C/h, and colorless block-shaped crystals of 1 were obtained with 81% yield (based on H4X).
