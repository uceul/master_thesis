A mixture of L3-H8 (1 mg, 0.82 μmol) and Cu(ClO4)2·6H2O (1.21 mg, 3.26 μmol) was dissolved in a solvent mixture of DMF (0.1 mL), H2O (0.025 mL), and 2 M HCl (10 μL) in a screw-capped vial. The resulting solution was placed in an oven at 80 °C for 18 h. Green crystals (1.42 mg, 68%) with a very thin plate shape were obtained after filtration. Solvent content calculated from the proposed formula: DMF, 40.0%; H2O, 2.8%. Solvent content determined by 1H NMR/TGA: DMF, 40.5%; H2O, 2.7%.
