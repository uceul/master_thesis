A mixture of Cd(NO3)2·4H2O (0.308 g, 1.0 mmol), H3IDC (0.078 g, 0.50 mmol), bpy (0.078 g, 0.50 mmol), KOH (0.084 g, 1.5 mmol), and water (10 mL) was sealed in a 25 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel vessel and heated at 170 °C for 7 days, and then cooled to room temperature at a rate of 10 °C/h. The pH values of the solution before and after reactions remain ca. 6. Pale cuboid crystals of 3 were collected, washed with distilled water, and dried in air. Yield: 0.190 g, 63% based on Cd(NO3)2·4H2O (the flake-shaped crystals of 4 were simultaneously formed with a yield less than 2%, which were separated by hand). Anal. Calcd for C35H30Cd5N11O20.5: C, 28.12; H, 2.02; N, 10.31%. Found: C, 27.89; H, 1.74; N, 10.54%. IR data (KBr, cm−1): 3427m, 1599s, 1468s, 1414m, 1369s, 1287s, 1070w, 834m, 810m, 666m, 631m, 543w.
