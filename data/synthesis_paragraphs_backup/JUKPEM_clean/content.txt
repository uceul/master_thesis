K12.5Na1.5[NaP5W30O110]·15H2O (82.4 mg, 0.01 mmol), bpz (9.5 mg, 0.05 mmol), and NiCl2·6H2O (35.7 mg, 0.15 mmol) were mixed with 6 mL of H2O in a cup-shaped vial. Then, the reactants were stirred for 10 min at room temperature (pH = 5.16), and the vial was capped and placed in an oven at 160 °C for 3000 min. After the reaction mixture cooled to room temperature, the resulting green block-like crystals were obtained in 45% yield (based on nickel). Anal.
