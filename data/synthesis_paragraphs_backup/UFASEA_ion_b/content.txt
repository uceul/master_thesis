A mixture of Cd(NO3)2·4H2O (0.308 g, 1.0 mmol), H3IDC (0.039 g, 0.25 mmol), bpy (0.078 g, 0.50 mmol), KOH (0.042 g, 0.75 mmol), and water (10 mL) was sealed in a 25 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel vessel and heated at 170 °C for 7 days, and then cooled to room temperature at a rate of 10 °C/h. The pH values of the solution before and after the reactions remained ca. 6. Colorless flake-shaped crystals of 4 were collected, washed with distilled water, and dried in air. Yield: 0.056 g, 21% based on Cd(NO3)2·4H2O. Anal. Calcd for C32.5H28.5Cd4KN10.5O19.5: C, 28.56; H, 2.10; N, 10.76. Found: C, 29.03; H, 2.26; N, 11.03. IR data (KBr, cm−1): 3361m, 3090m, 1611s, 1532s, 1463s, 1361s, 1240m, 1222m, 1087s, 845m, 805s, 667m, 631m, 543m, 502m.
