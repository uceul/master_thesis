
In a typical synthesis 45.0 mg (0.197 mmol) of 2-fluoro-1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylic acid were dissolved in 4 mL of DMA including 0.28 mL of HNO3 (20%). Afterwards 0.4 mL of a Cu(NO3)2·3H2O solution (200 mg mL−1) were added and the reaction mixture was heated to 100 °C for 48 h. The resulting green MOF single crystals were collected by filtration, washed with DMA and dried in air to yield 75.7 mg of UHM-32. For activation the as synthesized form of the MOF was treated by soxhlet extraction with ethanol for 20 h. After the solvent exchange the MOF was thermally activated in vacuum for 20 h at 120 °C.
