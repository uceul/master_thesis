Synthesis of {[Zn(bpe)0.5(Htbip)(tbip)0.5]·H2O}n (1). A mixture of Zn(NO3)2·6H2O (0.2 mmol), bpe (0.2 mmol), H2tbip (0.2 mmol) in deionized water (6 mL) was sealed in a 25 mL Teflon‐lined stainless steel autoclave, heated at 130 °C for 72 h, and slowly cooled to room temperature during 24 h. Colorless rod crystals were recovered by filtration, washed by distilled water, and dried in air at ambient temperature. Yield: 57 % (based on Zn). C24H27NO7Zn (506.88): calcd. C 56.87, H 5.37, N 2.76 %; found: C 56.69, H 5.31, N 2.80 %.
