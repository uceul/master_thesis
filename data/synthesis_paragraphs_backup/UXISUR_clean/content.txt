
In a typical synthesis, the sodium salt of trimesic acid or benzene-1,3,5-tricarboxylic acid (BTC) (0.2 mmol, 46 mg) and Cu(NO3)2·3H2O (0.2 mmol, 48 mg) were dissolved separately in 10 mL DI water and EtOH, respectively. Further, 2 mL of metal solution was gradually layered above 2 mL of sodium salt of trimesic acid solution in a narrow glass tube using 1 mL of buffer (1:1 DI water and EtOH) solution. Blue block shaped crystals were obtained from the junction of the layer after four days. The Cu-MOF crystals were separated and washed with EtOH and subsequently air dried (yield: 58%). The bulk compound was prepared in powder form by the direct mixing of the ligand mixture with corresponding solution of the metal salts followed by overnight room temperature stirring. The Cu-MOF/rGO hybrid was prepared by dispersing Cu-MOF and rGO powder in EtOH under ultra-sonication for 30 min by acquiring them in different ratios and after optimization and considering all the factors, 1:1 (by weight) was found to be optimum as can be observed from Fig. S1a and b. Eventually, the final product was harvested by rotary evaporation and subsequent thorough washing with EtOH and DI water as well as drying at 80 °C for 24 h.
