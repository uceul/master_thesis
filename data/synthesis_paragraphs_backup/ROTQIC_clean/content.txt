Synthesis of [Zn2(L)2(DMF)2] (1): LH2 (18 mg, 0.05 mmol), Zn(NO3)2⋅6 H2O (15 mg, 0.05 mmol), DMF (1 mL), and EtOH (1 mL) were placed in a Teflon‐capped glass vial, which was heated at 90 °C for 48 h and then cooled to room temperature. Growth of colorless crystals occurred upon cooling to room temperature, and the desired product was obtained in approximately 70 % yield. Crystal data for 1: Formula C38H30N6O18Zn2, monoclinic, space group P21, a=8.6937(7) Å, b=20.6607(18) Å, c=12.0563(11) Å, β=101.903(2)°, V=2119.0 (3) Å3, Z=2, T=200(2) K, R=0.0922, wR2=0.2519, GOF=1.026.
