
A mixture of NiO (0.0150 g, 0.2 mmol), H4MDIP (0.0344 g, 0.1 mmol), DMF (1.5 mL), and H2O (1.5 mL) was placed in a Teflon reactor (20 mL) and heated at 105 °C for 3 days. After the mixture was gradually cooled to room temperature at a rate of 10 °C h−1, green block crystals of 2 were obtained with 69% yield based on H4MDIP. Anal.
