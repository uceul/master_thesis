It was obtained from a reaction mixture of H2SBA (0.0612 g, 0.2 mmol), KOH (0.0561 g, 1 mmol), DMF (7 mL), EtOH (2.0 mL), and H2O (1.0 mL). The mixture was heated at 120 °C for 2 days. The colorless crystals of 2 were filtered off, washed with EtOH, dried at room temperature, and collected with the yield of 0.0725 g (41.26%, based on the H2SBA). Anal. found/calcd.: N, 0.8/1.3; C, 43.2/43.3; H, 2.6/3.5% for 2. IR (KBr, cm–1): 3426(br), 1668(w), 1560(m), 1375(w), 1293(m), 1163(s), 1100(s), 1010(w), 870(w), 833(w), 780(w), 682(w), 609(s), 572(w), 458(w), 411(w).
