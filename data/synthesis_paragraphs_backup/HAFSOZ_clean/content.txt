
Zn(NO3)2·6H2O (30 mg, 0.1 mmol), HO-H3BTC (11 mg, 0.05 mmol), and 4,4′-bipyridine (7.8 mg, 0.05 mmol) were dissolved in 4 mL of mixed solvent of DMA and H2O (1:1, v/v) in a 10 mL glass vial. After the mixture was stirred for 10 minutes, the vial was sealed and placed in a 95 °C oven for 3 days. Colorless block crystals were obtained after cooling to room temperature. The yield was about 70% based on the metal. IR spectrum (cm−1): 3306m, 1608s, 1541s, 1359s, 1278s, 1100w, 1013w, 832m, 789m, 702m. Elem. anal.: Calcd for NUM-2: C, 34.56; H, 3.51; N, 3.78. Found: C, 34.66; H, 3.72; N, 3.80.
