
A mixture of CuSO4·5H2O (0.12 g, 0.48 mmol), 3-dpye (0.04 g, 0.15 mmol), K6P2W18O62·15H2O (0.30 g, 0.06 mmol) and H2O (10 mL) was stirred for 30 min at the room temperature. The pH value was then adjusted to about 3.5 using 1.0 M HCl. The suspension was transferred to a Teflon lined autoclave (25 mL) and kept at 120 °C for 4 days. After slow cooling to room temperature, blue block crystals of 1 were obtained. Yield 30% based on W. IR (KBr pellet, cm−1): 3359 (m), 2343 (m), 1649 (s), 1606 (m), 1539 (s), 1475 (m), 1429 (m), 1342 (w), 1203 (w), 1091 (s), 1031 (m), 962 (s), 916 (s), 806 (s), 740 (m), 696 (m), 599 (m), 580 (w), 551 (w).
