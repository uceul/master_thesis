
A mixture of Cd(NO3)2·4H2O (0.1542 g, 0.5 mmol), H3EIMDC (0.0921 g, 0.5 mmol), ethanol (3 mL) and deionized water (3 mL) was adjusted to pH ca. 4 with 1 M sodium hydroxide and transferred into a 25 mL Teflon-lined reactor then sealed. This mixture was then heated to 180 °C for 5 days under autogenous pressure. After the mixture was cooled to room temperature at a rate of 4 °C h−1, colorless block crystals were collected in 53.6% yield. Anal. calcd for C7H9N2O6Cd (%): C, 25.49; H, 2.73; N, 8.50. Found (%): C, 25.34; H, 2.58; N, 8.42. IR data (solid KBr pellet cm−1): 3411(br), 2982(w), 1571(m), 1469(vs), 1387(m), 1354(m), 1283(w), 1119(m), 859(w), 810(w), 780(w), 654(w), 542(w), 488(w).
