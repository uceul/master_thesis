
Zn(NO3)2·6H2O (10 mg, 0.0336 mmol) and H2ipbpBr (5 mg, 0.0125 mmol) were dissolved in a mixture of DMF (N,N-dimethylformamide) (1 mL) and H2O (1 mL), and then HNO3 (400 μL, 2.7 M in DMF) was added. The solution was sealed in a 20 mL vial and heated at 80 °C for 36 hours, and then cooled to room temperature. Light yellow shuttle-shaped crystals of 1 were collected by filtration with a 54% yield based on H2ipbpBr. CHN elemental analysis (%) for 1, C18H15N3O9Zn: C 45.29, H 3.22, N 8.49. Anal. Calcd: C 44.81, H 3.11, N 8.71.
