A mixture of bpeb (20.1 mg, 0.070 mmol), H2bdc (11.6 mg, 0.070 mmol), and Zn(NO3)2·4H2O (18.4 mg, 0.070 mmol) dissolved in DEF (3 mL), H2O (1 mL), and DMSO (0.5 mL) was placed in a 10 mL glass tube, and 3–4 drops of 0.1 M NaOH was added. The tube was sealed and kept at 110 °C for 48 h, followed by cooling to room temperature over 8 h. Yellow block-shaped crystals of 1 suitable for X-ray analysis were obtained. Yield: 72%. Anal.
