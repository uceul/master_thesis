Compound 1 was synthesized from a solvothermal one-pot reaction of MnCl2·4H2O and H2IP in DEF solution at 150 °C for 5 d. All the materials of reagent grade were purchased from commercial sources and used without further purification. A mixture of H2IP (0.2 mmol, 0.0332 g), MnCl2·4H2O (0.25 mmol, 0.0612 g) and DEF (5 mL) was placed in a 25 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel vessel and was stirred at room temperature for 5 min. The mixture was then heated at 150 °C for 5 d, followed by slowly cooling down to room temperature at a rate of 10 °C/h. Light yellow crystals of [Mn(IP)1.5(HCOO)(DEF)]n were collected through filtration and washed with distilled water and ethanol for several times. The product yield was 40% in weight based on manganese. Elemental analysis (C, H and N) was carried out with a Vario EL elemental analyzer. Anal. Calc. for C18H18Mn2NO9: C, 43.01; H, 3.58; N, 2.79. Found: C, 43.13; H, 3.49; N, 2.87%. FT-IR spectra (KBr) were recorded in the range of 4000–400 cm−1 on a Bruker IFS 66v/S Fourier-transform infrared spectrometer. FT-IR (KBr, cm−1): 1658 s, 1611 s, 1562 s, 1402 vs 1210 w, 943 vw, 831 w, 781 w, 758 s, 718 s, 658 s, 451 s.
