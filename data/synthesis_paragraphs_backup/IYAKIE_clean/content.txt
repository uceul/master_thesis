
A mixture of Cd(OAc)2·2H2O (99 mg), 9-AC (55 mg), H2BDC (42 mg), Ca(OH)2 (5 mg), methanol (1 mL) and DMA (4 mL) were mixed and sealed in a 25 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave and heated at 150 °C for 4 days. The autoclave was subsequently cooled to room temperature. Colourless crystals were recovered by filtration, washed with DMA and ethanol, and finally dried at ambient temperature (29.4% yield based on H2BDC). CHN elemental analysis: anal. for 5: C 43.02 wt%, H 3.65 wt%, and N 3.19 wt%; calc. for 5: C 43.18 wt%, H 3.48 wt%, and N 3.31 wt%. IR (KBr, cm−1): 3468 (m), 3309 (m), 1555 (s), 1503 (m), 1437 (m), 1394 (s), 1312 (m), 1149 (w), 1108 (w), 1020 (m), 1109 (m), 841 (m), 519 (m).
