A mixture of Cd(NO3)2·4H2O (0.030 g, 0.10 mmol), H3bpt (0.014 g, 0.05 mmol), Hbtz (0.05 mmol), and DMF (5 mL) was sealed into a 23 mL Teflon‐lined stainless steel vessel and heated at 120 °C for 4 d. After being slowly cooled to room temperature, colorless block crystals suitable for single crystal X‐ray diffraction were obtained by filtration. Yield: 33 % (based on H3bpt). C24H18Cd2N4O7 (699.24): calcd. C 41.19; H 2.57; N 8.01 %; found: C 41.21; H 2.56; N 8.05 %. IR (KBr):  = 3421 (m), 2412 (w), 1548 (s), 1487 (s), 1341 (s), 1296 (s), 1213 (m), 1134 (w), 987 (w), 912 (s), 878 (s), 824 (m), 765 (w), 726 (w) cm–1.
