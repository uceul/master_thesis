Hpy·Be3(OH)(HPO4)3 (2b): A mixture of BeSO4·4H2O (0.089 g), H3PO4 (0.144 g, 85 wt.‐%), pyridine (0.101 g), H2O (1.0 mL), and isopropyl alcohol (4.0 mL) was sealed in a 20 mL Teflon‐lined steel autoclave and heated at 180 °C for 6 d. After cooling to room temperature, colorless crystals of 2b were recovered by filtration, which were washed with distilled water and dried in air (82.0 % yield based on beryllium). C5H10Be3NO13P3 (412.09): calcd. C 14.57, H 2.45, N 3.40; found C 14.36, H 2.37, N 3.46. IR (KBr pellets):  = 3450 (m), 3110 (m), 2890 (w), 1640 (m), 1490 (m), 1140 (vs), 754 (s), 679 (s), 492 (s) cm–1.
