Terephthalic acid (0.1 mmol, l6.6 mg) was dissolved in DMF (5 mL) using ultrasound, and then, 1,2,4-triazole (0.1 mmol, 6.9 mg), Cd(NO3)2·4H2O (0.1 mmol, 29.8 mg), NaClO4 (5.0 mg) and 1.0 mL of distilled water were added to the transparent solution. Ultimately, the resulting transparent solution was sealed in a glass bottle, which was heated at 100 °C for 24 h. After reaction, colorless flaky crystals were obtained.
