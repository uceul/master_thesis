A mixture of H6BHB (6.7 mg, 0.011 mmol) and Zn(NO3)2·6H2O (15.8 mg, 0.053 mmol) was dissolved in DMF (2 mL) and MeOH (1 mL) in a screw-capped vial. After two drops of water were added to the mixture, the vial was capped and placed in an oven at 65 °C for 24 h. The resulting hexagonal prism-shaped single crystals were washed with DMF for several times to produce MOF-2 (7.4 mg, yield: 59.2%). Elemental analysis: Calcd. for Zn3(BHB)(DMF)3(MeOH)1.5·(DMf) (C43.5H46N4O17.5Zn3): C, 47.37; H, 4.17; N, 5.08; Found: C, 47.48; H, 4.60; N, 5.49.
