The cobalt phosphate-oxalate, was synthesized under mild hydrothermal conditions starting from a gel containing piperazine as the structure-directing agent. In a typical synthesis, 0.487 g of cobalt chloride was dissolved in 3.6 ml of water and 0.14 ml of phosphoric acid (aqueous, 85 wt.%) was added to the mixture and stirred vigorously to result a clear pink colored solution. 0.516 g of oxalic acid and 0.35 g of piperazine were added to the above under continuous stirring. Finally, 0.78 g of borax was added and the gel was homogenized for 30 min. The final mixture with a composition, 2CoCl2·6H2O:1H3PO4:2H2C2O4·2H2O:2C4N2H10:1Borax:100H2O, was transferred into a PTFE-lined stainless steel autoclave (Parr, Moline, USA) and heated initially at 150°C for 72 h and finally at 170°C for 72 h. The final resulting product contained large quantities of dark-pink colored rectangular plate-like crystals, suitable for single-crystal X-ray diffraction, was filtered and washed with deionized water. The initial characterization was carried out using powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). A powder XRD pattern revealed that the product is a cobalt analogue of the recently discovered iron phosphate-oxalate [9]. To our knowledge, this is the first cobalt phosphate-oxalate material that has been synthesized and characterized. The role of borax in the synthesis mixture is still not clear. Our experiments in the absence of borax in the synthesis mixture clearly indicated a lower yield for the product.
