Synthesis of [Cu(3,4-PDC)(DMF)]n,1. Cu(NO3)2·2.5H2O (18.6 mg, 0.08 mmol) and 3,4-pyridinedicarboxylic acid (6.68 mg, 0.04 mmol 3,4-H2PDC) were added to a 2 mL solution of N,N‘-dimethylformamide (DMF) and ethanol (EtOH) in a 20 mL scintillation vial, heated to 85 °C for 12 h, and cooled to room temperature. The as-synthesized green-blue crystals are insoluble in water and common organic solvents.
