
Benzo-(1,2;3,4;5,6)-tris(thiophene-2′-carboxylic acid) (H3BTTC) (100 mg, 1.6 × 10−4 mol) and Cd(NO3)2·4H2O (300 mg, 1.3 × 10−3 mol) were dissolved in 15 mL of dimethylacetamide (DMA) with 20 drops of HBF4 (40%) in a vial. The vial was tightly capped and placed in a 100 °C oven for 72 h to yield 218 mg of pale yellow cubic crystals (yield: 76% based on H3BTTC). The crystal has a formula of Cd13(BTTC)8(OH)2(H2O)16·18DMA, which was derived from crystallographic data,elemental analysis (% calc/found: C 36.28/36.96, H 3.52/3.65, N 3.97/3.91), and TGA.
