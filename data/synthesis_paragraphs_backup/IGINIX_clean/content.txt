In a 20 mL vial, Zn(NO3)2·6(H2O) (250 mg, 0.840 mmol) was dissolved in 10 mL of DMF, followed by the addition of 2,5-pyridinedicarboxylic acid (144 mg, 0.862 mmol). The vial was capped and sonicated until turbid and heated to 100 °C for 2 days. A vial containing colorless prisms was removed from the oven while hot and allowed to cool to RT. The crystals were collected via vacuum filtration and rinsed with DMF (257 mg, 95% yield based on Zn(NO3)2·6(H2O)). Anal. Calcd for C43H47N9O21Zn4 (1): C, 40.12%; H, 3.68%, N, 9.79%; Zn, 20.31%. Found: C, 40.47%; H, 3.85%, N, 9.59%; Zn, 20.0%.
