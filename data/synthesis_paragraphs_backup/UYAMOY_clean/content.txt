A mixture of Cd(NO3)2·4H2O 0.062 g (0.2 mmol), H2BDC 0.033 g (0.2 mmol), PTAZ 0.06 g (0.4 mmol), and 6 mL DMF in a 20 mL vial, while stirring at room temperature. After a few minutes, the mixed solution was sealed, heated at 100 °C for 5 days and then slowly cooled to room temperature. Colorless block-shaped crystals of as-synthesized 2 were collected in 37% yield based on Cd(II). The phase purity of compound was checked by powder X-ray diffraction (Figure S1).
