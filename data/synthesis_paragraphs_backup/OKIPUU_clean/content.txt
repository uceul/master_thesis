A mixture of Cd(NO3)2·4H2O (30.1 mg, 0.1 mmol), H2bdc (16.6 mg, 0.1 mmol), and BIDPE (30.2 mg, 0.1 mmol) was dissolved in 12 mL of DMF/H2O (3:1, v/v). The final mixture was placed in a Parr Teflon-lined stainless steel vessel (15 mL) under autogenous pressure and heated at 90 °C for 3 days. The large quantities of colorless-plank crystals of 2 were obtained in 76% yield based on BIDPE. Anal. Calcd for C110H98O28N18Cd4: C, 51.43; H, 3.81; N, 9.82. Found: C, 51.35; H, 3.85; N, 9.83.
