For detailed experimental procedures including syntheses and characterization data, see the Supporting Information. Briefly, commercial HfOCl2·8H2O (123 mg, 0.3 mmol), benzoic acid (2.7 g, 22.1 mmol), and N,N-diethylformamide (DEF, 8 mL) were added to a 20 mL screw-necked glass vial, and the mixture was sonicated to create a fine dispersion. Commercially available meso-tetra(4-carboxyphenyl)porphyrin-Fe(III) chloride (FeTCP-Cl, 53 mg, 0.06 mmol) was added to give a dark-purple suspension. The mixture was placed in a 120 °C oven for 48 h. The reaction vial was removed from the oven and allowed to cool to room temperature. The supernatant was gently decanted, and then fresh N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF, 20 mL) was added to the vial and shaken. The suspension was transferred to a 50 mL centrifuge vial. The dark (orange under microscope) crystals were isolated by centrifugation, washed five times with fresh DMF (45 mL through repeated centrifugation), and then soaked in fresh DMF (45 mL) for 12 h at 50 °C to wash any unreacted species from the resulting MOF crystals. Then, the dark crystals were isolated by centrifugation, resuspended in acetone (45 mL), and washed five times with fresh acetone (45 mL). Finally, the crystals were soaked in acetone (45 mL) for 12 h for a final rinse. The solid was activated at room temperature under vacuum followed by 120 °C under vacuum for 12 h to yield needlelike crystals with hexagonal faces of Hf-2 (55 mg, 49% yield).
