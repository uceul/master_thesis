A mixture of H3MIDC (34.0 mg 0.2 mmol), Cd(NO3)2 4H2O (61.6 mg, 0.2 mmol), pyridine (0.2 mL), and deionized water (7 mL) was sealed in 25 mL Teflon-lined bomb and heated at 160 °C for 96 h, and then cooled to room temperature at a rate of 10 °C/h. Good quality colorless crystals for 2 were filtered off, washed with water and dried in air. Crystals of 2 are stable in the air. Yield: 76.3%. Compound 2 could also be synthesized in 52% yield under the solvothermal condition: a mixture of H3MIDC (52 mg, 0.3 mmol), CdCl2 2.5H2O (64.0 mg, 0.3 mmol) was dissolved in deionized water (3 mL) and then CH3CN (4 mL) was added to the mixture. The solution was transferred into a 25 mL Teflon-lined bomb and heated at 150 °C for 96 h. After the mixture was cooled to room temperature at a rate of 10 °C/h, colorless crystals of 2 were collected. Anal. Calc. for C24H20N8O24Cd4: C, 22.99; H, 1.61; N, 8.94. Found: C, 22.63; H, 1.79; N, 8.71%. IR (cm−1, KBr): 3383 (m), 2932 (w), 2410 (s), 1563 (s), 1485 (s), 1340 (m), 1260 (w), 1184 (m), 854 (w), 770 (m), 493 (w).
