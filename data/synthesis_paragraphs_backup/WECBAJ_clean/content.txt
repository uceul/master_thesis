‡ The synthesis of 1. Compound 1 was synthesized by solvo(hydro)thermal reaction of Zn(NO3)2(1 mmol), H3PO4 (6 mmol), 4,4′-bipyridine (6.4 mmol) in ethylene glycol (2 ml) and water (6 ml) mixed solvent. The mixture was sealed in a 20 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave under autogenous pressure, and heated at 180 °C for 24 h. After cooling to room temperature at 3 °C h−1, brown lamellate crystals were obtained. The yield was 65% based on Zn. Elemental analysis (%) for 1: calc: C 25.89, H 2.46, N 6.04; found: 25.35, H 2.38, N 6.10. Crystal data. Data collections were performed with Mo-Kα radiation (0.71073 Å) on a Rigaku R-AXIS RAPID IP area-detector, the structures were solved by direct methods and all non-hydrogen atoms were subjected to anisotropic refinement by full matrix least-squares on F2 using the SHELXTL program.
