
A mixture of H2MFDA (0.1 mmol, 28.2 mg), Eu(NO3)3·6H2O (0.1 mmol, 44.7 mg), DMF (5 mL), CH3CH2OH (2 mL) and H2O (1 mL) was sealed in a 25 mL Teflon-lined bomb and heated at 120 °C for 3 d. The reaction mixture was slowly cooled to room temperature. Colorless rod-like crystals of 1 suitable for single crystal X-ray diffraction analysis were isolated in 56% yield. Elemental analysis (%) calcd for C36H40Eu2O19: C, 40.01; H, 3.73%. Found: C, 40.46; H, 3.58%. IR (KBr, cm−1): 550 w, 678 w, 779 s, 1110 w, 1385 vs, 1431 s, 1550 s, 1585 s, 1654 s, 2961 w, 3421 m.
