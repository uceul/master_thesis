A mixture of CdCl2·2.5H2O (0.2 mmol, 0.0456 g), Htrz (0.2 mmol, 0.0140 g), DFH (0.2 mmol, 0.0176 g), H2O (4.0 mL), and MeCN (4.0 mL) was heated at 160 °C in a 15 mL capacity Teflon-lined reaction vessel for 3 days under autogenous pressure. The mixture was cooled to room temperature at a rate of 0.1 °C min−1. Colorless polyhedron crystals were isolated in 42% yield, washed with H2O, and air dried. Elemental analysis calcd (%) for C6H7N7ClCd3: C, 13.10; H, 1.28; N, 17.83. Found: C, 13.05; H, 1.23; N, 17.91. IR (solid KBr pellets, cm−1): 3436 (s), 1623 (w), 1495 (s), 1272 (m), 1197 (w), 1150 (s), 1166 (s), 987 (m), 875 (w), 669 (m), 471 (w).
