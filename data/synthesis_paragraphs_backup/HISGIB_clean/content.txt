The complex 4 was obtained from a reaction mixture of H2SBA (0.186 g, 0.6 mmol), CsCl (0.1684 g, 1 mmol), DMF (7.0 mL), EtOH (2.0 mL), and H2O (1.0 mL). The mixture was heated at 90 °C for 2 days. The colorless crystals of 4 were filtered off, washed with EtOH, dried at room temperature, and collected with the yield of 0.0202 g (38.17%, based on the H2SBA reagent). Anal. found/calcd.: N, 2.6/2.0; C, 38.6/38.2; H, 3.4/3.4% for 4. IR (KBr, cm–1): 3504(w), 3442(w), 3364 (br), 3092(w), 2920(w), 1940(w), 1668(s), 1596(w), 1543(w), 1392(s), 1209(w), 1157(s), 1100(s), 1000(m), 959(w), 802(w), 715(s), 620(s), 573(s), 520(s), 453(m).
