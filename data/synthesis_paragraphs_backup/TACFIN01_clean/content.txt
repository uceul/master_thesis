All chemicals were purchased from Aldrich (USA) and used without further purification. In a typical synthesis, the following reagents were used: zinc oxide (0.39 g, 4.76 mmol), cobalt(II)oxalate dihydrate (0.6 g, 4.76 mmol), triethyl phosphate (0.87 g, 4.76 mmol), and 1,2 diaminoethane (0.25 g, 4.76 mmol) were added to 10 ml of doubly distilled water, and stirred at room temperature for 30 min. The mixture was transferred in to a 100 ml Teflon container inserted in a stainless steel vessel and heated in the oven at 180 °C for 4 days. The reaction produced a mixture of purple crystals, [NH3–CH2CH2NH3][Co0.7Zn1.3(PO4)2] (1) and burgundy red crystals identified as Co6.2(OH)4(PO4)4Zn1.80 (2) as the two major products for a total yield of 0.89 g, in almost 80% yield based on the metal analysis of the product and the amount of zinc oxide in starting material. The optical microscopy view is shown in Fig. S1, as supplementary material submitted. The crystals were manually separated using magnifying glasses, which was good enough for single crystal X-ray analysis, FTIR and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) on 1 and 2. Elemental analysis conducted by Schwarkopf microanalytical laboratory, NY on the mixed product yielded 25.68% cobalt and 25.84% zinc and confirmed the 1:1 ratio of Co:Zn in the composition. The Fourier Transform FTIR spectra were recorded within 400–4000 cm−1 region on an IR 200 Thermo Nicolet spectrometer. FTIR for 1. (KBr, cm−1), 3450 (s), 2964 (s), 2910 (s), 1656 (s), 1620(s), 1528 (s), 105, 1026 (vs), 623 (s); for 2, 3400 (s), 1631 (s), 1103, 1021, 953, 650–590 (s). Thermogravimetric analysis was carried out on a TA instrument at a temperature range of 30–700 °C.
