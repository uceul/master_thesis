A mixture of Cu(H2SalPyMeCam)(NO3)2 (0.018 g, 0.030 mmol), H2BDC (0.0067 g, 0.04 mmol,) and Cd(NO3)2·4H2O (0.0123 g, 0.04 mmol) in DMF (3 mL) was sonicated for 10 min and heated in a 20 mL scintillation vial with a screw cap at 120 °C for 24 h. M′MOF-4 could be isolated in ∼57% yield as green thin plates. Elemental analysis (%): Calcd for Cd3(BDC)3[Cu(SalPyMeCam)]·(DMF)9(H2O)2 (C73H105N13O25CuCd3): C, 44.61; H, 5.38; N, 9.26; Found: C, 44.60; H, 5.16; N, 9.02.
