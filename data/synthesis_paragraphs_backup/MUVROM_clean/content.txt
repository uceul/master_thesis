Synthesis of 1. A mixture of Co(Ac)2 ∙ 4H2O (0.1 mmol, 24.9 mg), 1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylic acid (0.05 mmol, 10.5 mg), dtb (0.05 mmol, 10.6 mg), H2O (6 mL) and acetonitrile (4 mL) was sealed in a 25 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel vessel and heated at 160 °C for 3 days. The reaction mixture was slowly cooled to room temperature at a rate of 3 °C/h, and the purple block crystals were obtained. Yield based on Co: 10.1 mg, 56.5%. Elemental analysis (%) for C56H50Co6N12O35, found (calcd): C, 37.43(37.27); H, 2.68(2.79); N, 9.41(9.31). IR (KBr, cm− 1): 3115(w), 2972(w), 1615(m), 1540(s), 1355(s), 1056(m), 711(m), 673(m).
