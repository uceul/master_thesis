A mixture of H4L (0.025 mmol, 10.2 mg), AgNO3 (0.075 mmol, 12.7 mg) and DMF (5 mL) was sealed in a 15 mL Teflon-lined bomb and heated at 85 °C for 2 days, and then cooled to room temperature at a rate of 5 °C/h. Colorless diamond-like crystals of 2 suitable for X-ray diffraction analysis were isolated in 36% yield. Elemental analysis calcd. for C28H24Ag4N2O10: C, 34.29; N, 2.86; H, 2.45%. Found: C, 34.45; N, 2.78; H, 2.32%. IR data (KBr, cm−1): 491 w, 571 w, 652 w, 715w, 786 w, 1020 w, 1342 m, 1378 vs, 1557 s, 1655 w, 3401 s.
