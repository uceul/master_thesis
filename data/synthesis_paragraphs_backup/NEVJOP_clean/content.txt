
Zn(NO3)2·6H2O (1 mmol, 297 mg), bpy (0.4 mmol, 60 mg), and THF (5 mL) were added into a solution of H4adtp (0.2 mmol, 60 mg) in H2O (5 mL) which was adjusted to the pH value at ca. 8.0 with 1 mol L−1 NaOH solution. The mixture was sealed into a 25 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave. The autoclave was heated at 120 °C for 96 hours, and then allowed to cool to 30 °C for 24 h. Colorless crystals of complex 2a were collected in 67% yield based on H4adtp. Anal. Calcd for C27H28N5O16Zn3 (Mr = 874.76): C, 37.07%; H, 3.22%; N, 8.00%. Found: C, 37.31%; H, 3.34%; N, 7.89%. Selected IR data (KBr pellet, cm−1): 3542 (s), 3418 (s), 3084 (m), 1650 (vs), 1574 (vs), 1532 (s), 1490 (m), 1462 (m), 1422 (s), 1373 (s), 1318 (s), 1260 (m), 1222 (br), 1191(br), 1162 (w), 1110 (w), 1072 (br), 943 (m), 817 (s), 769 (br), 731 (br), 634 (br).
