
A mixture of CuI (18 mg 0.095 mmol), H2L (5 mg, 0.015 mmol), DMF (1 mL), DABCO (0.2 mL) and HNO3 (0.3 mL) (2.2 mL HNO3 in 10 mL DMF) was sealed into a 20 mL capped vial and kept for 6 hours at room temperature until it became dark brown. The mixture was heated at 85 °C for 24 hours and blue block crystals of JLU-Liu32 were obtained. The crystals were collected and washed with DMF (yield 55%, based on H2L). Elemental analysis calcd (%) for JLU-Liu32, [(Cu4I4)Cu3L3(DABCO)(DMF)2]·18DMF: C, 42.13; H, 5.32; N, 10.79; found: C, 41.24; H, 5.20; N, 10.98. The experimental PXRD pattern agrees well with the simulated one based on the single-crystal X-ray data, indicating the purity of the as-synthesized product (Fig. S2).
