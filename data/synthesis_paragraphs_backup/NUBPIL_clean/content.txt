‡ Synthesis of [Cu2L(H2O)]·2Cl·2DMF·4H2O (1). CuCl2·2H2O (10 mg, 0.06 mmol), H2L (10 mg, 0.04 mmol) and 0.6 mL aqueous HCl (0.1 M) were dissolved in DMF (10 mL) at room temperature. The mixture was sealed in a screw cap vial and heated at 80 °C for 2 days. Blue crystals of 1 were collected by filtration, washed with DMF and acetone, and dried at room temperature. Yield: 18 mg (67% based on Cu). Anal. Calcd for C28H36Cu2N6O15Cl2 (%): C, 37.59; H, 4.06; N 9.39. Found (%): C, 37.05; H, 4.21; N, 9.47.
