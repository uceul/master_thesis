
5,5′-(Naphthalene-1,4-diylbis(ethyne-2,1-diyl))diisophthalic acid, H4NDED (12.6 mg, 0.025 mmol) and Cu(NO3)2·3H2O (25 mg, 0.1 mmol) in 2 mL DMF (DMF = N,N′-dimethylformamide) with 15 μL concentrated HNO3 were stirred for a few minutes in air and the clear solution was transferred into an autoclave Teflon-lined stainless vessel (20 mL). The vessel was sealed and heated to 65 °C for 2 days and then cooled to room temperature at a rate of 5 °C hour−1. Pale green block crystals of HNUST-2 were filtered and washed with DMF. Yield was 12 mg (∼75% based on the ligand).
