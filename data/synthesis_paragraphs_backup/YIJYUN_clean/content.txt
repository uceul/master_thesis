
A mixture of cis,cis,cis-cyclopentanetetracarboxylic acid (H4CPTC, 122.2 mg, 0.5 mmol), trans-1,2-bis(4-pyridyl)-ethylene (TBPE, 91.6 mg, 0.5 mmol), NaHCO3 (40.9 mg, 0.5 mmol), and 6.0 mL distilled water were added to a 20 mL beaker. The zinc salt Zn(NO3)2·6H2O (302.3 mg, 1.0 mmol) was dissolved in 4.0 mL of distilled water. The two solutions were mixed together with an initial pH of about 3.5, and was sealed in a Teflon-lined stainless vessel, which was then heated at 105 °C for 60 h under hydrothermal conditions. The process resulted in the formation of colorless columnar crystals of FJU-5 in a 36.3% yield (mg, mmol), based on the H4CPTC ligand. The solid product was washed with distilled water and isolated on a filter. The phase purity of the crystalline FJU-5 was verified by powder X-ray diffraction. The PXRD pattern of the bulk products are in good agreement with a pattern simulated from single-crystal X-ray diffraction data for FJU-5 (Fig. S1). Elemental analysis confirmed the stoichiometry of FJU-5. Anal. calcd: C 41.71, H 3.58, N 4.63% for the formula: [Zn2(C9H6O8)(C12H10N2)(H2O)]·1.75H2O. Found: C 42.02, H 3.52, N 4.66%. IR (ATR-IR): ν = 3487 (w), 3326 (m), 2964 (w), 1601 (vs), 1535 (vs), 1510 (s), 1456 (m), 1418 (vs), 1344 (w), 1303 (s), 1257 (w), 1220 (w), 1072 (w), 1049 (w), 1034 (m), 1024 (w), 1001 (m), 862 (m), 841 (s), 805 (w), 761 (m), 730 (m) cm−1.
