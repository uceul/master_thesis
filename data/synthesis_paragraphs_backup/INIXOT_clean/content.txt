Synthesis: The title compound was synthesized under mild hydrothermal conditions. MgCl2·6H2O (4.0662 g, 20 mmol) and B2O3 (2.7848 g, 40 mmol) were mixed in deionized water (40 mL) whilst stirring. H3PO4 (5.2 mL, 85 %) and pyridine (4 mL) were added dropwise to the mixture in sequence. After being stirred homogeneously, the mixture was evaporated and condensed to about 20 mL in a water bath. Pyridine (2 mL) and HCl (2 mL, 37 %) were added to the mixture, which resulted in a clear gel with a pH value of 1. The gel was sealed in a Teflon‐line stainless steel autoclave and heated to 170 °C for 3 d. The resulting colorless transparent crystals with a hexagonal bipyramids shape (10 % yields based on Mg) were recovered by filtration, and dried for 1 d at 60 °C. (H3O)Mg(H2O)2[BP2O8]·H2O: calcd. B 3.62, P 20.80, Mg 8.15; found B 3.55, P 20.71, Mg 8.25. During our study on the preparation of the title compound, we found that the presence of the pyridine in the crystallization system seems to be critical for the growth of the crystals because without pyridine no crystals of the title compound appeared in the reaction product. Pyridine appears to be used as a buffer to adjust the pH value of the reaction system.
