H2L (0.1148 g; 0.5 mmol) and CdCl2 (0.2284 g, 1 mmol) were dissolved separately in dimethylformamide (DMF)/H2O (10:10, v/v) solution. Meanwhile, 10 mL of adenine (0.0405 mol L–1) DMF solution was also prepared, and mixed with the H2L and CdCl2, DMF/H2O (10:10, v/v) solutions. Each 0.5 mL of the above mixed solution was added to 3.5 mL of DMF/EtOH (1.5/2, v/v) solution in a 10 mL glass tube. The reaction mixture was heated at 80 °C for 3 d. After the cooling treatment, red-brown crystals of 1 were washed several times with mother liquor and dried (yield: 72%, based on H2L ligand). Anal.
