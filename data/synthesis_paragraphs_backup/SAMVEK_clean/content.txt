Compound 1a: 0.137 g (0.53 mmol) of Mn(NO3)2·4H2O was dissolved in 3 mL of methanol and 2 mL of acetic acid was added to this. The solution was kept undisturbed for some time. Then 0.089 g (0.5 mmol) of terephthalic acid dissolved in 3 mL of DMA was added to it, and the mixture was sonicated for 5 min. The whole mixture was put into a closed glass vial and kept at 100 °C in the oven for 6 days. Colorless crystals were formed, washed with DMF many times, and dried under a vacuum for further use.
