Synthesis of [Zn(2,7‐ndc)] (1): To a solution of Zn(NO3)2·6H2O (0.119 g, 0.40 mmol) and 2,7‐ndcH2 (0.087 g, 0.40 mmol) dissolved in DMF (2.6 mL) was added NEt3 (0.222 mL, 0.40 mmol), and the solution was vigorously stirred for 2 h. The clear solution was sealed in a glass vial, and then heated to 110 °C for 20 h. Polyhedral crystals thus obtained were guest‐exchanged with CH3CN and CHCl3 and evacuated by heating to 150 °C for 12 h under vacuum (0.015 g, 13 %). C12H6O4Zn (279.56): calcd. C 51.55, H 2.16; found C 51.51, H 2.85.
