‡ Synthesis of 1: A mixture of Zn(NO3)2·6H2O (297 mg, 1.0 mmol), H2bdc (166 mg, 1.0 mmol), L (184 mg, 0.5 mmol) and water (10 mL) was heated at 150 °C for 72 h in a 23 mL Teflon reactor under autogenous pressure and then cooled to room temperature at a rate of 10 °C h−1. Colorless crystals of 1 were obtained in 76.2% yield based on Zn(NO3)2·6H2O. Elemental analysis calc. for C44H32N2O13Zn2.5 (M = 960.14): C, 55.03; H, 3.56; N, 2.92.
