Synthesis of [Zn(dpe)(bdc)]⋅4H2O (ZndB): A mixture of dpe (0.0184 g, 0.1 mmol), Zn(ClO4)⋅6H2O (0.0372 g, 0.1 mmol), Na2bdc (0.0210 g, 0.1 mmol), and deionized water (6 mL) was sealed in a Teflon‐lined stainless steel vessel (25 mL), which was heated at 120 °C for 72 h, then cooled slowly to room temperature. Colorless crystals of ZndB were obtained after standing for several days. Yield: 0.0253 g (52.23 %); IR (KBr pellet): =3376(m), 3369(w), 1620(s), 1591(vs), 1431(s), 1228(m), 749(s) cm−1; elemental analysis calcd (%) for C20H24N2O8Zn (Mr=485.78): C 49.35, H 5.28, N 6.39; found: C 49.54, H 5.27, N 6.42.
