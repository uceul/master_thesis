A mixture of Ba(NO3)2 (31.36 mg, 0.12 mmol), La(NO3)3·6H2O (8.6 mg, 0.02 mmol), and H3L (17.4 mg, 0.1 mmol) was vigorously stirred for half an hour in H2O (5 mL) and DMF (5 mL), and then HNO3 (30 μL, 2 M) was injected into the reaction system. The mixed reaction solutions were added into a Teflon vessel in a stainless steel autoclave, heated at 160 °C for 12 h, and then automatically cooled to 25 °C during the period of 72 h. The resulting block-shaped colorless single crystals were washed thoroughly with 1,1′-oxybis-ethane and deionized water. Yield: 41% based on H3L. Elemental analysis calcd (%) for C65.5H59.5Ba3La0.5N4O21: C 45.74, H 3.49, N 3.26; found: C 45.95, H 3.81, N 3.59. FT-IR data (cm–1): 3400(br), 1640(m), 1580(m), 1530(m), 1438(m), 1410(m), 1360(m), 1015(m), 945(w), 840(w), 780(s), 705 (w), 650(w), and 505(w). Ion detection was performed on the desolvated Ba–La complex 1. A sample of 1·3DMF was heated at 130 °C in the oven for 24 h to afford the desolvated Ba–La complex. Elemental analysis calcd (%) for C55.5H39.5Ba3La0.5N2O18.5: C 44.09, H 2.63, N 1.85; found: C 44.36, H 2.85, N 1.97. The PXRD result of the desolvated Ba–La complex 1 also was determined (Figure S2), demonstrating that the microporous framework is retained after guest solvent molecules are removed.
