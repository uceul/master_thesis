17Preparation of 2: 3,3′,5,5′‐azobenzenetetracarboxylic acid[16] (16.0 mg, 0.044 mmol), In(NO3)3⋅2 H2O (22.0 mg, 0.065 mmol), DMF (1 mL), CH3CN (0.5 mL), piperazine (0.1 mL, 0.4 M in DMF), and HNO3 (0.28 mL, 2.7 M in DMF) were added to a vial, and the solution was heated to 85 °C for 12 h. Orange‐colored polyhedral crystals were collected and air‐dried (16.6 mg, 72 % yield). The as‐synthesized material is insoluble in H2O and common organic solvents. Elemental analysis calcd (%) for 2, C24H21N4O22In3: C 27.15, H 1.99, N 5.28; found: C 27.32, H 2.51, N 5.18.
