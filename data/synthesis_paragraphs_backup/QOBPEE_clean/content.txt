Him·Be3(OH)(HPO4)3 (2a): A mixture of BeSO4·4H2O (0.089 g), H3PO4 (0.115 g, 85 wt.‐%), imidazole (0.034 g), water (0.9 mL), and ethylene glycol (4.0 mL) was sealed in a 20 mL Teflon‐lined steel autoclave and heated at 180 °C for 8 d. After cooling to room temperature, colorless crystals of 2a were recovered by filtration, which were washed with distilled water and dried in air (89.8 % yield based on beryllium). C3H9Be3N2O13P3 (401.07): calcd. C 8.98, H 2.26, N 6.98; found C 9.05, H 2.21, N 6.87. IR (KBr pellets):  = 3150 (s), 2990 (w), 2870 (w), 1640 (m), 1390 (m), 1140 (vs), 723 (s), 490 (s) cm–1.
