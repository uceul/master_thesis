
A mixture of Co(OAc)2·4H2O (0.0249 g, 0.1 mmol), KH2TDA (0.0312 g, 0.16 mmol) and HTZ (0.0070 g, 0.1 mmol) was dissolved in H2O (3 mL) and DMF (3 mL). Ammonia solution (25% to 28%, 1 drop) and triethylamine (1 drop) were added into the mixture (pH = 10). The mixture was sealed in a 25 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel reactor, heated at 90 °C for 72 h, and subsequently cooled to room temperature at a rate of 0.8 °C h−1. Red block crystals of 3 in ca. 40% yield were obtained. Anal. calcd for C50H80N37O77Co8K5 (%): C, 19.38; H, 2.60; N, 16.73. Found (%): C, 19.57; H, 2.69; N, 16.59. IR (KBr, cm−1): 3448s, 1668s, 1394w, 1408vs, 1311m, 1123m, 846w, 704w, 530w.
