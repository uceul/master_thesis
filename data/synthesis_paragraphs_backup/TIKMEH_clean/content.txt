A mixture of Cd(NO3)2·4H2O (0.102 g, 0.33 mmol), H3BTB (0.062 g, 0.25 mmol), bpy (0.039 g, 0.25 mmol), LiOH·H2O (0.021 g, 0.50 mmol), 3 mL of water and 3 mL of glycol was put into a 25 mL Teflon-lined Parr, heated to 160 °C for 3 days and then cooled to room temperature at a rate of 2 °C h−1. Colorless crystals were obtained. Elemental analysis (%) found (calcd.) for 2: C 41.11 (41.04), H 3.02 (2.95), N 5.08 (5.19); Yield: 44%. IR (KBr, cm−1): 3396 br, 1560 vs, 1460 s, 1380 vs, 1222 m, 1066 m, 941 w, 813 m, 772 m, 718 m, 631 m.
