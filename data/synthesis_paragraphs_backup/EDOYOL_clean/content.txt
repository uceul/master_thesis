
ZCP-THO was prepared by employing hydrothermal methods. Typically, ZnO (240 mg), 2CoCO3
·3Co(OH)2·xH2O (600 mg), H3PO4 (85%, 0.6 ml) and 4 ml H2O were mixed together and stirred for about half an hour. Then 1,3-propanediamine (PDA, 0.8 ml) was added. The mixture was stirred until homogeneous, then transferred to a Teflon-coated autoclave. After heating at 180 °C for two weeks, the autoclave was cooled to room temperature at a rate of 10 °C min−1. The product, a crop of blue crystals, was recovered by suction filtration, washed with deionized water and dried under ambient temperature and conditions. The purity of the resulting solid product was checked by X-ray powder diffraction (Fig. 1). The ratio of Zn : Co was determined by using inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES). The analysis
was carried out on an Automscan Advantage instrument (Thermo Jarrel Ash Corporation) and indicates that the crystal products contain 22.1 wt% Zn, 10.6 wt% Co and 15.79 wt% P, suggesting that the molar ratio of (Zn + Co) : P = 0.52 : 0.51. The Zn : Co molar ratio is 0.655 : 0.345.
