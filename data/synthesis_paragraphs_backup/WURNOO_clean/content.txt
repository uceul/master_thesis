‡ Synthesis of [CuII4(μ4-O)L4][CuI6Br8] (1): a mixture of Gd2O3 (0.25 mmol, 0.091 g), CuBr (0.30 mmol, 0.043 g) and HL (0.50 mmol, 0.099 g) was added to a mixed solution of pivalic acid (0.202 g, 2.00 mmol) and water (5 ml). After stirring for half an hour, the mixture was sealed in a 20 ml vial and transferred into a preheated oven at 180 °C for 13 days, and then cooled to room temperature. The orange single crystals of 1 were washed with water and ethanol, and dried at room temperature (yield: 40%). Elem anal. calcd for C48H32Br8Cu10 N4O9: C 27.67, H 1.55, N 2.69. Found: C 28.45, H 1.59, N 2.66%. The phase purity of 1 has also been confirmed by powder X-ray diffraction (Fig. S11, ESI).
