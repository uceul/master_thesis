‡ Synthesis of [Cd9((R)-PIA)6(TIB)4(H2O)12]·3H2O (1-D): the mixture of Cd(CH3COO)2·2H2O (0.2 mmol, 0.053 g), (R)-H3PIA (0.032 g, 0.1 mmol), TIB (0.2 mmol, 0.055 g), DMF (3 ml) and H2O (1 ml) was sealed in a 20 ml vial and heated to 100 °C for 3 days. After cooling to room-temperature, the colourless polyhedral crystals 1-D were separated from the mixture by filtration (yield: 42%). Similar procedure was used to synthesis compound 1-L (yield: 45%).
