pDBI (0.020 g, 0.05 mmol) dissolved in DMF (1.5 mL) was added to an aqueous solution (2.5 mL) of Gd(NO3)3⋅6H2O (0.023 g, 0.05 mmol) and was sonicated for 10 min. The turbid solution was kept in a tightly capped 5 mL vial for 72 h at 110 °C to afford rod‐shaped golden crystals (0.035 g, 70 % yield). FTIR (KBr, cm−1): νOH 3206, νN−H 2987, νas(CO2) 1632, νs(CO2) 1400. Elemental analysis (%) calcd for C72H86N14O29Gd2: C 40.51, H 5.25, N 8.59; found: C 40.57, H 5.21, N 8.62.
