A mixture of 5-aminoisophthalic acid (0.181 g, 1 mmol), Pr6O11 (0.150 g, 0.147 mmol), HNO3 (3.00 mmol), and H2O (10 mL) was heated to 150 °C for 50 h in a 23 mL Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave, and then it was cooled to room temperature at 10 °C h−1 to obtain colorless platelike single crystals of 2 (yield: 5%). Anal. found: C, 26.53; H, 3.10; N, 6.38. Calcd: C, 26.46; H, 3.05; N, 6.43. Main IR frequencies (KBr, cm−1): 3395, 3258, 3189, 2928, 1620, 1540, 1475, 1410, 950, 880, 815, 780.
