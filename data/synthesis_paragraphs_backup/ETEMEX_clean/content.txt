
A mixture of H2nip (0.1 mmol), Co(NO3)2·6H2O (0.1 mmol) in 7.5 mL v/v = 1:1 ethanol/H2O solution and btrb (0.05 mmol) in 0.5 mL DMF was adjusted to pH = 7 with dilute NaOH solution. The mixture was added to a 25 mL Teflon-lined stainless autoclave and sealed and then heated at 130 °C for 4 days and then cooled to room temperature to give the dark red block crystals of 2·4H2O (yield: 0.068 g). Anal. calc. for C36H37Co4N9O27 (2·4H2O): C, 34.22; H, 2.95; N, 9.98%; found: C, 34.13; H, 3.03; N, 10.05%.
