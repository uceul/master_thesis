
A mixture of Ni(NO3)2·6H2O (0.015 mmol, 5.3 mg), H4qptc (0.0050 mmol, 2.4 mg) and DMF/cyclohexanol/H2O (1.0 mL, v/v/v, 1/4/5) was added into a hard glass tube, pumped into a near-vacuum, and heated at 130 °C for 2 days, then cooled to room temperature at a rate of 2 °C h−1. Green crystals of 1 were obtained by filtration, cleaning, and drying in air. Yield: 28%. Anal. calcd for C62H62Ni3O22.5N3: C, 53.71; H, 4.47. Found: C, 56.58; H, 2.91.
