Synthesis of 1: Salt 3-cyanobenzoate, Na(3-cba), was prepared by the reaction of 3-Hcba and NaOH in an equivalent molar ratio in hot aqueous solution. A mixture of Na(3-cba) (0.085 g, 0.5 mmol), NaN3 (0.065 g, 1.0 mmol), Cd(NO3)2·4H2O (0.308 g, 1.0 mmol) and Co(NO3)2·6H2O (0.145 g, 0.5 mmol) in water (8 mL) was heated in a 25 mL teflonlined autoclave at 140 °C for 2 days, and then cooled to ambient temperature. The orange-yellow block crystals were obtained with a yield of 61% based on cobalt. Anal. Calc. (%) for C16H15CdCoN5O8: C, 33.32; H, 2.62; N, 12.14. Found (%): C, 33.24; H, 2.53; N,12.07.
