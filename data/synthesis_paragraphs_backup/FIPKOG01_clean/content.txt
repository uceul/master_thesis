[CdL]·[+H2N(CH3)2](DMF)(H2O)3 (MOF1): A mixture of H4L (24.6 mg, 0.05 mmol), CdCl2·2.5H2O (22.8 mg, 0.13 mmol), DMF (8 mL), H2O (3 mL) and 4 drops of HNO3 were homogeneously mixed whilst being stirred. The mixtures was then sealed in a 25 mL stainless steel vessel and statically heated at 85 °C for 3 d under autogenous pressure, and then cooled to room temperature. Colorless block crystals of MOF1 were obtained by filtration, yield 76.2 % based on Cd. C31H41CdN5O14 (820.09): calcd. C 45.32, H 4.99, N 8.53; found C 44.61, H 5.22, N 8.26. IR (KBr pellet):  = 3425 (br), 1623 (vs), 1565 (vs), 1423 (w), 1376 (vs), 1163 (s), 1016 (m), 868 (vs), 780 (m), 730 (m) cm–1.
