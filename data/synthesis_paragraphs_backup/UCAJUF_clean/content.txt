[Zn4(μ3‐OH)2(H2O)2(ZnTCPEP‐H)2(DABCO)2]·2DMF·10.5H2O (Zn4·ZnTCPEP·DABCO): A mixture of Zn(NO3)·6H2O (157 mg, 0.526 mmol), ZnTCPEP‐H4 (100 mg, 0.105 mmol), and DABCO (24 mg, 0.210 mmol) was dissolved in DMF/EtOH/H2O (70:4:1) (75 mL) in a Teflon‐lined stainless steel vessel. One drop of HCl (1 M) was added, and the solution was heated to 80 °C for 48 h. The resultant green block crystals were filtered, washed with DMF, and dried under vacuum to give [Zn4(μ3‐OH)2(H2O)2(ZnTCPEP‐H)2(DABCO)2]·2DMF·10.5H2O (146 mg, 99.8 % yield). C130H115N14O32.5Zn6 (2785.84): calcd. C 56.05, H 4.16, N 7.04; found C 55.92, H 3.80, N 7.20. IR:  = 1654 (s), 1601 (s), 1538 (m), 1498 (w), 1386 (s) cm–1. TG/DTA under atmospheric conditions: a weight loss of 15.7 % was observed below 200 °C; calcd. 12.0 % for 2DMF and 10.5H2O.
