Synthesis of [C3N2H5]2·[Zn3(HPO3)4] 2. Compound 2 was prepared from a mixture of ZnO (0.113 g), H3PO3 (0.74 mL, 50 wt %), imidazole (0.19 g), and H2O (2.5 mL) in a molar ratio of 1:4:2:100. The reaction mixture was sealed in a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave and then heated at 180 °C for 4 days under static conditions. The product containing prismatic crystals were collected by filtration, washed thoroughly with distilled water, and dried in air at room temperature (21% yield based on Zn). The agreement between the experimental and simulated XRD patterns indicated the phase purity of the product (Figure 1b). The difference in reflection intensities between the simulated and experimental patterns was due to the variation in preferred orientation for the powder sample. The ICP and elemental analysis results were also consistent with the theoretical values. Calculated for the compound:  Zn, 29.99; P, 18.94; C, 11.01; H, 2.16; N, 8.57%.
