
A mixture of 2-nitroimidazole (2-nim, 0.0156 g, 0.14 mmol), NH2-H3BTB (0.0156 g, 0.036 mmol), Zn(NO3)2·6H2O (0.0416 g, 0.14 mmol), tetraethylammonium bromide (0.075 mmol, 0.0156 g), which was used to facilitate the crystallization of the product, and DMF/H2O (v:v = 3:0.5, 3.5 mL) was heated in a 20 mL scintillation vial at 100 °C for 24 hours, followed by cooling to room temperature. The resulting mixture was washed with DMF and water, and colorless block crystals were collected and dried in air. Calcd for [Zn2(NH2-BTB)][2-nim]·DMF·6H2O: C, 45.32; H, 4.26; N, 8.04; found: C, 44.97; H, 4.54; N, 8.37.
