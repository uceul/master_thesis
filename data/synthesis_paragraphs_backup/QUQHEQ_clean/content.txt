Yellow crystals of 1 with pseudohexagonal external morphology were synthesized by stirring Zn carbonate basic (0.075 g, 0.219 mmol), l-aspartic acid (0.175 g, 1.32 mmol), and 4,4′-bipyridyl (0.103 g, 0.66 mmol) in a water/methanol mixture (2.65/1.35 mL, respectively), giving a molar composition for the reaction of 1:2:1 Zn/asp/bipy. The resulting mixture was sealed in a 23 mL autoclave and heated at 130 °C for 3 days. Upon cooling at a rate of 0.2 °C min−1 to room temperature, the product was filtered and washed with water and methanol. The pH before the reaction was 5.2, increasing to 7.2 after the reaction. Yield = 11.95% based on Zn2+. Elemental analysis (%): found (calc for Zn2(C8H7NO8)(C10H8N7)(H2O)3) C = 37.17 (37.05), H = 3.60 (3.63), N = 7.24 (7.21).
