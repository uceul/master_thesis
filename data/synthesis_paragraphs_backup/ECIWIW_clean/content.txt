Synthesis of [Cd(4-pyridylacrylate)2]·H2O (4). A heavy-walled Pyrex tube containing a mixture of Cd(ClO4)2·6H2O (0.22 g, 0.5 mmol) and trans-4-pyridylacrylic acid (0.15 g, 1 mmol) in ethanol (0.4 mL) was frozen, sealed under vacuum, and placed inside an oven at 130 °C. Colorless prismatic crystals were obtained after 48 h of heating. Yield:  0.11 g (53%). Anal. Calcd (found) for CdC16H14O5N2:  C, 45.0 (44.6); H, 2.83 (3.16); N, 6.56 (6.49). Thermogravimetric analysis of 4 revealed a 4.6% weight loss by 75 °C, corresponding to the loss of one water molecule per formula unit (4.2%).
