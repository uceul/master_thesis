1 is constructed from 1,2,4,5-tetrakis(3-carboxyphenyl)-benzene (m-H4TCPB) (Scheme 1), which can be straightforwardly synthesized by the coupling and hydrolysis reaction, from its precursor. A mixture of Cu(NO3)2·3H2O (0.02 g) and m-H4TCPB (0.01 g) was dissolved in N, N′-diethylformamide (DEF, 1.5 mL), water (0.4 mL), and con. HCl (8 μL). The final mixture was placed in a 20 mL glass vial, which was sealed and heated at 75 °C for 24 h, and then cooled to room temperature. Rhombus-shaped turquoise crystals of 1 were collected in 42% yield (based on ligand m-H4TCPB). Anal. calcd for C49H55O13N3Cu2: C, 57.64; H, 5.43; and N, 4.12. Found: C, 57.70; H, 5.46; and N, 4.17. IR/cm− 1: 2972 (m), 1615 (m), 1538 (s), 1395 (s), 1371 (s), 820(m), 767 (s), and 710(s). It was formulated on the bases of single-crystal X-ray structure determination, elemental analysis, and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). A single-crystal X-ray crystallographic study revealed that 1 crystallizes in the monoclinic system and C2/c space group [18]. As quite frequently observed in MOFs, the framework contains paddle-wheel binuclear {Cu2(COO)4} secondary building units (Fig. 1a), which are bridged by organic m-TCPB ligands to form a two-dimensional (2D) hexagonal grid {Cu2(m-TCPB)2} (Fig. 1b). The adjacent 2D hexagonal grid is packed in parallel, leading to the final porous-containing three-dimensional (3D) frameworks with the cavities of 8.5 × 12.6 Å2 (Fig. 1d). The structure of 1 is non-interpenetrated and the topology (Fig. S2) can be best described as a simple 4, 4 connected net (Fig. 1c, d), which exhibits the same topology as well-established MOFs, such as: MOF-2 Zn(BDC)-(DMF), Cu(BDC-OH), Zn2(TBAPy), and UTSA-72 [19], [20], [21], [22]. The fifth coordination sites of paddle–wheel Cu2(COO)4 units were occupied by water molecules, which will be critical for the gas-absorption selectivity. Upon water molecules removal, the open sites will be exposed for other applications. The solvent accessible volume after the removal of the uncoordinated solvents is 59.6% calculated with PLATON [23].
