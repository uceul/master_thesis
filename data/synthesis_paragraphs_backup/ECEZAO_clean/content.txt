Preparation of [Ni3(OH)2(trans-1,4-chdc)2(H2O)4]·4H2O (2). Ni(H2O)6(NO3)2 (2.0 g) was dissolved in distilled water (ca. 40 mL), and a solution of the partially neutralized mixture of cis- and trans-1,4-cyclohexanedicarboxylic acid (0.59 g) with NaOH (0.13 g) was added. The resulting suspension was stirred, followed by the addition of a solution of NaOH (0.13 g). The final mixture was placed in the Teflon-lined autoclave that was then sealed and heated to 140 °C for 1 day. It was allowed to cool to room temperature in a cold water bath. Pale green cubelike crystals of 2 in a clear solution were obtained. The crystals were washed with water and acetone and dried in air. Yield = 40%. Anal.
