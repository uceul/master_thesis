A mass of 47.6 mg (0.200 mmol) of CoCl2·6H2O and 44.6 mg (0.100 mmol) of H3BTB was dissolved in 5 mL of anhydrous DMA. The resulting solution was transferred into a Pyrex tube. After the tube was tightly sealed, it was heated to 120 °C for 7 days. Block-shaped deep purple crystals were collected, washed with DMA, and then air-dried for 1 day. Yield = 30.9 mg, 32.8%. EA calc for [Co3(BTB)2(DMA)2]·7DMA·3H2O (C90H117N9O24Co3, fw = 1885.76 g/mol). 2. Calc: C = 57.32; H = 6.25; N = 6.68%. Found: C = 57.47; H = 5.97; N = 6.58%.
