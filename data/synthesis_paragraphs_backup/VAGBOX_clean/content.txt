
Gd(NO3)3 (0.045 g, 0.1 mmol), CuI (0.019 g, 0.1 mmol), NaI (0.030 g, 0.2 mmol) and Hpba (0.030 g, 0.15 mmol) were placed in 5 mL of H2O/ethanol (v:v = 2:3) solution and stirred for a few hours, then transferred and sealed in a 15 mL Teflon-lined steel autoclave. The autoclave was kept in an oven at 100 °C for 3 days. After cooling to room temperature, light yellow block crystals were collected by filtration, washed with ethanol and dried in air (yield 37%). Elemental analysis calcd (%) for 3 (GdCu3I3C38H32N3O8): C 32.87, H 2.31, N 3.05; found: C 32.69, H 2.19, N 2.94. Selected IR peaks (cm−1): 3059, 2974, 1545, 1431, 1045, 773.
