[In(popha)(1,10‐phen)]⋅4 H2O (InPF‐21), CH synthesis: a mixture of H3popha (0.119 g, 0.343 mmol), 1,10‐phen (0.061 g, 0.343 mmol), and In(OAc)3 (0.100 g, 0.343 mmol) in distilled water (8 mL) was heated in a Teflon‐lined stainless steel autoclave at 160 °C for 72 h. After cooling to room temperature, crystals were isolated by filtration and washed with distilled water, ethanol, and acetone to give yellow crystals of InPF‐21 (0.220 g, 91 %). MW synthesis: H3popha (0.040 g, 0.114 mmol), 1,10‐phen (0.034 g, 0.114 mmol), In(OAc)3 (0.033 g, 0.114 mmol), and water (2 mL) were placed in a MW glass vial and submitted to MW radiation by using a dynamic method at 160 °C with vigorous stirring over 60 min at 200 W and 7 bar to give the product InPF‐21 (0.072 g, 96 %). Elemental analysis calcd (%) for C27H22InN3O13 (711.3 g mol−1): C 45.59, H 3.12, N 5.91; found: C 45.86, H 2.86, N 5.79; IR (KBr): 3455 (O−H, H2O), 3248 (C−H, aromatic, 1,10‐phen), 3081 (C−H, aromatic)L, 1621 and 1606 (C=O)L, 1590 (C=C, aromatic)L, 1563 (N−O)as, 1527 (C=N, 1,10‐phen), 1496 and 1456 (OCO)s, 1432 and 1403 (OCO)as, 1383 (C−C)as, 1348 and 1311 (N−O)s, 1263 and 1252 (C−O)as, 1150 and 1107 (C−C)s, 1074 and 982 δoop(C−H, phen), 779, 748, and 724 cm−1 δoop(C−H)L; TGA (air, 100 mL min−1): Initial weight loss started at ≈100 °C, which was due to the loss of water molecules that had been physisorbed inside the framework (total loss ≈7 %), and at ≈450 °C the loss of 68 % of material was observed. The final residue at ≈800 °C corresponded to 25 % of the material that had been converted into In2O3 (ICSD_640179).
