Then, the mixture was sonicated for 5 minutes. The pH of the reaction was maintained at 8–9 by adding diluted NaOH solution. Afterwards, it was kept in an oven at 100 °C for 120 h. Colorless crystals were collected (in 70% yield with respect to the ligand) and washed many times to remove the unreacted crystallized ligand molecules.
