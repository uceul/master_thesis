Synthesis of 1: A mixture of H3L (10.0 mg, 0.024 mmol) and Cu(NO3)2⋅3 H2O (23.2 mg, 0.096 mmol) was dissolved in DMF (4 mL) in a 10 mL screw‐capped vial. To this solution, HNO3 (0.6 mL) was added, and the vial was tightly capped and placed in an oven at 70 °C for 3 days. The obtained block‐like blue crystals were washed twice with DMF and dried in air to afford 1 (yield≈60 % based on H3L). IR (KBr): =1658, 1602, 1398, 1257, 1176, 1101, 1016, 862, 781, 738, 698, 665 cm−1.
