
A mixture of Zn(CH3COO)2·2H2O (0.34 g), H3PO4 (0.26 mL), 3-(aminomethyl)pyridine (0.41 mL), methanol (4 mL) and H2O (1 mL) in the molar ratio of 1:3:2.6:65:36 was sealed in a Teflon-lined autoclave and heated at 160 °C for 7 days. After cooling to room temperature, colorless rod-like crystals of III were recovered by filtration, washed with distilled water, and dried in air (72.4% yield based on zinc). Anal.
