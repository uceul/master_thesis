A mixture of Co(NO3)2·6H2O (0.060 g, 0.2 mmol), HTPA (0.040 g, 0.2 mmol), DMF (2.5 mL), and H2O (2.5 mL) was added to a 23 mL Teflon bomb, and then heated to 120 °C for 36 h. After cooling to room temperature during a period of 60 h, yellowish block crystals suitable for single-crystal X-ray study were harvested. The yield was 53% (based on HTPA). IR (cm–1): 3422 (br), 3018 (br), 1594 (s), 1384(s), 1107 (s), 1016 (s), 867 (m), 815 (s), 790 (m), 747 (m), 707 (m), 620 (m). Anal. Calcd (%) for 3 (C89H105Co7N27O32): C, 43.15; H, 4.27; N, 15.26. Found: C 43.59, H 4.38, N 15.08.
