First, 0.5 g P2O5 was dissolved in 10 ml water contained in a 23-ml teflon pot (Caution! This reaction is extremely vigorous). Then, 0.285 g ZnO, 0.444 g oxalic acid dihydrate, and 0.522 g 1,3-diaminopropane were added sequentially. The unstirred vessel was sealed and placed in an oven at 150°C for 3 days. Upon removal from the oven and cooling over several hours, the resulting solids were recovered by suction filtration and rinsing with acetone, resulting in a mixture of several crystal morphologies and powder. Most notable were the large (to 1 mm), perfectly faceted crystals of the title compound. The other crystalline phases in the mixture are being investigated further. As yet, preparation of pure [H3N(CH2)3NH3]0.5·ZnPO4 has proved impossible; in the absence of oxalic acid, it has not been synthesised at all.
