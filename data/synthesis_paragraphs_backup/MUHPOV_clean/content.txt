Compound 1 was prepared hydrothermally from a mixture of indium nitrate (In(NO3)3·4H2O), oxalic acid (H2C2O4), hydrogen phosphite (H3PO3), 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (dabco) and H2O with a molar ratio of 1: 2.36: 2.44: 4: 500. Typically, 350 mg indium nitrate was dispersed into 8mL H2O, followed by the addition of 300 mg H2C2O4 and 200 mg H3PO3 with stirring. Finally, 440 mg of dabco was added slowly to the above mixture. After stirring for 30 min, the mixture was transferred into a sealed Teflon-lined steel autoclave and heated at 160 °C for 3 days, then cooled to room temperature. Colorless plate-like crystals of compound 1 were collected and air-dried at room temperature (68% yield based on Indium). The purity of 1 was confirmed by comparison of the experimental powder X-ray diffraction pattern to the calculated spectrum based on the single-crystal structure (as shown in Fig. S1). The diffraction peaks on both spectra correspond well in position, indicating the phase purity of the as-synthesized sample.
