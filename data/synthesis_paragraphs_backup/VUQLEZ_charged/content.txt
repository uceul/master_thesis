‡ A mixture of 0.2429 g Eu2O3, 0.1106 g (CH3)2NH (40%), 1.6130 g concentrated sulfuric acid (98%) and 6.6418 g N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) in a 1:1.4:23:131 molar ratio was sealed in a 24 mL Teflon-lined autoclave and heated at 180 °C for 6 d. The autoclave was slowly cooled to the room temperature, and then the product was washed with water, dried at room temperature for about 24 h obtaining colourless crystals (0.28 g, yield 43.1%). Analysis found: C 9.20, N 5.37, H 3.30%. (Calcd: C 9.14, N 5.33, H 3.22%.) IR (KBr pellet, cm−1): 3433 (s), 1556 (m), 1508 (m), 1463 (m), 1165 (vs), 841 (m), 649 (s).
