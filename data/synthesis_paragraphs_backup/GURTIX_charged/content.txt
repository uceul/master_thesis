A mixture of In(NO3)3·5H2O (0.195 g, 0.5 mmol), 1,2,4-H3btc (0.32 g, 1.5 mmol), piperazine (0.388 g, 2 mmol ) and H2O (10 ml) was mixed in a 23 mL Teflon reactor, which was heated at 443 K for 3 days and then cooled to room temperature at a rate of 10 K h−1. Orange–yellow block crystals of 1 were obtained in 78% yield after being washed with distilled water and dried in air. Anal. Calcd. for C17H23In2O18.5 (1): C, 27.12; H, 3.08. Found: C, 27.33; H, 2.92. IR (KBr, cm−1): 3455(s), 1618(s), 1488(m), 1383(s), 1311(w), 1024(w), 588(m).
