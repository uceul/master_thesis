The mixture of btr (1.5 mmol, 0.54 g) and Cu(ClO4)2·6H2O (0.5 mmol, 0.173 g) was heated under reflux in 20 mL of H2O for 2 h and then the resulting solution was filtered. Blue single-crystals suitable for X-ray diffraction were obtained by slow evaporation in a glass vial within several days. Yield: 65%. Elemental analysis (%) calculated for 5: C 21.49, H 1.80, N 37.59; found: C 21.40, H 1.78, N 37.05. IR (KBr pellets, λ, cm−1): 3443.7s, 3099.2m, 1635.4m, 1507.9w, 1121.1m, 619.2m.
