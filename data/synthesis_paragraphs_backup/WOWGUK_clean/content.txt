
First, 4.4761 g Zn(NO3)2
(BDH Analar, 98%) was added to 30 ml of 1 M H3PO4
(made up from 85% BDH Analar H3PO4 solution) in a glass beaker. Once the Zn(NO3)2 had dissolved, 37.277 g of ethylene glycol was added, followed by 1.7872 g of 1,6-diaminohexane (Acros Organics, 99.5%), and the mixture was stirred for 10 min. A yellow–white precipitate appeared and heat was evolved. The mixture was then placed in an oven at 90°C for 4 days. The solids (yield = 0.605 g) were recovered by suction filtration and rinsing with acetone, providing light brown needle-like crystals (maximum linear dimension ca. 1 cm) of H3N(CH2)6NH3·Zn4(PO4)2(HPO4)2·3H2O and small amounts of powder. The product appears to be completely stable when stored in a sealed vessel in dry air. Hydrothermal treatment (ca. 66% filled 23 ml teflon-lined bomb) of the same reaction mixture at 150 or 180°C for 4 days also led to similar crystals of the title compound.
