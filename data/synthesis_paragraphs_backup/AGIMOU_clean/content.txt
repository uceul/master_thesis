A mixture containing Mn(NO3)2 (53.7 mg, 0.3 mmol), Hatz (25.5 mg, 0.3 mmol) and H2ip (16.6 mg. 0.1 mmol) was dissolved in mixed water–ethanol solution (10.0 mL, v:v = 1:1), and the initial pH value of the mixture was adjusted to ca. 6 by triethylamine. Then, the mixture was sealed in a Parr Teflon-lined stainless steel vessel (23.0 mL), and heated at 170 °C for four days under autogenous pressure. After the resulting mixture was cooled to room temperature at a rate of 3.0 °C h−1, colorless block-shaped crystals of 2 suitable for X-ray analysis were obtained directly, washed with water, and dried in air. Yield: 45% based on H2ip. Anal. Calc. for C12H16Mn2N10O6: C 28.47, H 3.19, N 27.67%. Found: C 28.45, H 3.20, N 27.65%. IR (KBr, cm−1): 3546(s), 3470(s), 3408(s), 3239(w), 1637(s), 1619(s), 1557(m), 1530(m), 1480(w), 1437(s), 1388(s), 1263(w), 1156(w), 1130(w), 1100(w), 1040(w), 743(m), 703(m), 623(m).
