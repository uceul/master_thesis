A mixture of Tb4O7 (0.060 g, 0.05 mmol) and H3tci (0.069 g, 0.20 mmol) was placed in a small via. Afterwards, DMF (2 mL), H2O (2 mL), and 2 drops concentrated nitric acid were added. The resulting mixture was kept at 110 °C for 3 d. After being slowly cooled to the room temperature, colorless prism crystals of 1 were isolated. Yield: 65 % based on H3tci. C15H20N4O10Tb (591.19): calcd. C 30.45; H 3.38; N 9.47 %; found: C 30.46; H 3.32; N 9.48 %. IR (KBr):  = 3463 (vs), 1687 (s), 1560 (w), 1458 (vs), 1330 (s), 1130 (m), 1034 (w), 849 (s), 594(s) cm–1.
