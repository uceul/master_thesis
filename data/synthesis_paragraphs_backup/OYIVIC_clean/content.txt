A 2.0 mL portion of 4-TBA solution (0.20 M) in 1:1 solution of DMF and EtOH was taken in a 5 mL vial. A 0.009 g portion (0.2 mmol) of anhydrous CuCl solid was added to this solution. Additional 0.5 mL of DMF was added to the above mixture; the vial was capped and heated at 90 °C for 72 h. After cooling to room temperature, two layers were seen, one was a plate light blue crystal of Cu-TBA-2 and other one was unreacted white starting materials. Then collected Cu-TBA-2 crystals were washed with EtOH (2 mL, 3 times) and DMF (5 mL, 2 times) and dried in air (10 min). [Yield: 61%, 0.0054 g depending on CuCl].
