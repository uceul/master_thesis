All reagents were of analytical grade. Compound 1 was hydrothermally prepared from a starting mixture containing indium trichloride (InCl3), phosphorous acid (H3PO3), diethylenetriamine (DETA) and hydrofluoric acid (HF). Indium trichloride was obtained hydrothermally by direct reaction of In2O3 with HCl at 160 °C for 3 days under autogenous pressure. Typically, 0.08 g InCl3 and 1.0 g H3PO3 was dispersed into a mixture of 8 ml water, followed by addition of 0.26 ml DETA and 0.4 ml HF (50%) with stirring. The mixture was further stirred for one hour at room temperature and heated at 160 °C for 7 days in a 18 ml Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave (filled up to 48% volume capacity), then slowly cooling down to the ambient temperature. Colorless block crystals of compound 1 were collected by filtration, washed with distilled water and air-dried. The yield of product was 57% in weight based on indium.
