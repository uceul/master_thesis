A mixture of CoCl2·6H2O (1.0 mmol), H3PO3 (2.0 mmol), trans-1,4-diaminocyclohexane (2.7 mmol), and H2O (10 mL) was stirred overnight in a Teflon cup. It was then sealed in an acid digestion bomb and heated to 160 °C for 72 h followed by slow cooling (6 °C/h) to room temperature. The product was recovered by filtering off and gave plate-like blue crystals of 1 mixed with some unidentified pink powder. Crystals of 1 suitable for single-crystal X-ray analysis were selected, and the structural determination indicated it as a new phase. 1 in a pure form can be obtained by heating a mixture of CoCl2·6H2O (1.5 mmol), H3PO4 (1.0 mmol), trans-1,4-diaminocyclohexane (2.9 mmol), and H2O (10 mL) under the same reaction conditions as above. The initial and final pH of the reaction solution was unchanged (10.2). The resulting mixture was recovered by filtering off and gave fine blue powder as product. The XRD pattern of the blue powder is consistent well with the pattern simulated from the coordinates of the previous blue crystals. Electron probe microanalysis confirmed the Co to P ratio of 3 to 2. The elemental analysis of the blue powder was also consistent with the formula from single-crystal study (Anal. found/Calcd.: C, 6.78/6.79; H, 3.32/3.42; N, 2.49/2.64). Based on the combined evidence, the blue powder was used as the pure form of 1 for further physical analyses.
