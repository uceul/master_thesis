Synthesis and Characterization. (C5H18N3)[Fe3(HPO3)6]·3H2O has been synthesized using mild hydrothermal conditions and autogenous pressure. H3PO3 (12 mmol) and Fe(SO4)3·5H2O (0.16 mmol) were dissolved in distilled water (20 mL), and N-(2-aminoethyl)-1,3-propanediamine (23 mmol) was added to the solution while stirring. A 10 mL portion of an organic cosolvent (butanol) was also added. The pH of the solution was 5. The solution was sealed in a PTFE-lined steel pressure vessel which, after 5 days at 170 °C, was slowly cooled to room temperature. Colorless crystals were separated by filtering, washed with water and acetone, and dried in air. The yield of the reaction was approximately 65% based on iron content.
