
A mixture of Gd2O3 (0.25 mmol, 0.091 g), 2-mercaptonicotinic acid (0.25 mmol, 0.039 g) and 12 ml H2O was stirred in air for 30 min and then sealed in a 23 ml Teflon-lined autoclave. After being heated at 180 °C for 7 days, the mixture was cooled down slowly to room temperature over 72 h. Large, light yellow crystals were obtained in a yield of 31% based on Gd. Anal.
