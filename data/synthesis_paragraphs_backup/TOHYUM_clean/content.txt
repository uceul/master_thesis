Synthesis of 1: A mixture of Zn(NO3)2 · 6H2O (0.060 g, 0.20 mmol), H2mbdc (0.034 g, 0.2 mmol), HNO3 (0.5 mol/L, 2 drops) and DMA (3 mL) was placed in a 20 mL small vial. The resulting mixture was stirred for 30 min at room temperature, and then the mixture was kept at 110 °C for three days. After being slowly cooled to the room temperature, colorless block crystals of 1 were isolated. Yield: 54% based on Zn(NO3)2. Anal. calc. for C36H41N3O17Zn4 (1049.28): C, 41.17; H, 3.91; N, 4.00%. Found: C, 41.19; H, 3.92; N, 3.98%. IR data (KBr pellet): 3431 (m), 3132 (w), 1654 (s), 1498 (s), 1439 (w), 1375 (m), 1281 (m), 1245 (w), 1194 (w), 1143 (s), 1107 (m), 1061 (m), 1012 (w), 987 (m), 671 (m), 662(s).
