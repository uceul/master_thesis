
A mixture of La(NO3)3·6H2O (0.043 g, 0.1 mmol), H3TTCA (0.018 g, 0.05 mmol), hydrochloric acid (1 drop) and DMF (8.0 mL) was heated at 120 °C for 24 h in a sealed Teflon-lined autoclave. The autoclave was cooled over a period of 18 h at a rate of 5 °C h−1. Colorless block-shaped crystals of 1 were collected by filtration. Yield: 60%.
