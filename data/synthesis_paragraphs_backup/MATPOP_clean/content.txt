A mixture of Tb(ClO4)3·6H2O (28.5 mg, 0.05 mmol), H2BPDC (24.4 mg, 0.1 mmol), ZnCl2 (6.8 mg, 0.05 mmol), H2O (1 mL), and DMA (4 mL) were added into a 8 mL glass vial. The glass vessel was heated at 80 °C for 3 days under autogenous pressure and then cooled to room temperature at 2 °C/h under ambient conditions. The colorless block crystals were obtained and washed with DMA. Yield: 50%, based on Tb(ClO4)3·6H2O. Elemental analysis (%) Calcd for compound 1 (TbZnC26H34.5N4.5O17.5Cl): C 32.86, H 3.63, N 6.64. Found: C 32.89, H 3.69, N 6.68.
