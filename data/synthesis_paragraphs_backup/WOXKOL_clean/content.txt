
A mixture of MnCl2·4H2O (0.015 mmol, 3.0 mg), H4qptc (0.005 mmol, 2.4 mg), 1,4-bib (0.01mmol, 2.1 mg), aqueous NaOH solution (0.02 mL, 0.5 mol L−1), and H2O/DMF (1 mL, v/v, 1/1) were heated at 130 °C for 1 day in a sealed tube, and then cooled to room temperature at a rate of 1.4 °C h−1. The pale yellow, block-shaped crystals were obtained with a yield of 58% (based on Mn). Elemental analysis (%): calcd for C20H20MnN2O8: C, 50.97; H, 4.28; N, 5.94. Found (%): C, 50.82; H, 4.27; N, 5.91. IR (KBr pellet, cm−1): 3669 (vs), 3260 (vs), 1598 (vs), 1523 (vs), 1399 (vs), 1325 (vs), 1163 (s), 1126 (s), 1102 (m), 1064 (vs), 1003 (s), 940 (s), 866 (m), 841 (vs), 792 (vs), 7549 (w), 717 (vs), 680 (m), 655 (s), 531 (m), 469 (s).
