
H3TCMTB (0.17 g, 0.30 mmol), Ba(NO3)2 (0.16 g, 0.60 mmol), N,N′-dimethylacetamide (7.5 g) and H2O (1.5 g) were mixed and homogenised for half an hour. The homogeneous mixture was then transferred into a 25 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave and heated at 120 °C for 5 days. Needle-like colourless crystals were obtained upon cooling the mixture to room temperature at a cooling rate of 2 °C h−1. Yield: 0.085 g, 23% based on H3TCMTB used. Mp: >250 °C. Anal. calcd for C188H234Ba9N20O68: C, 44.29; H, 4.63; N, 5.50. Found: C, 44.02; H, 4.33; N, 5.95. FT-IR: 3401, 2968, 2921, 1603, 1534, 1394, 1240 cm−1.
