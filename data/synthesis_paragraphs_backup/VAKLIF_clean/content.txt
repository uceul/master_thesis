
[Cd2(BDC)3(PR64)]·9H2O: A mixture of [PR64]2+·2[NO3]− (82 mg, 0.05 mmol), CdSO4·8H2O (230 mg, 0.3 mmol), H2BDC (0.2 mmol, 33 mg), and triethylamine (2 drops, where a 1 ml injection syringe is used) in water (3.5 ml) was heated at 140 °C for 48 h in a Teflon-lined stainless steel container and cooled to room temperature. Block colorless X-ray-quality crystals were collected and dried in air (yield: 20% based on [PR64]2+·2[NO3]−). Elemental analysis calc. For C78H106N28O39Cd2 (%): C, 41.01; N, 17.17; H, 4.68; Cd, 9.84; found: C, 41.53; N, 17.67; H, 4.24; Cd, 9.95. IR (cm−1, major absorbances): 3444 (w), 1733 (s), 1566 (s), 1474 (s), 1377 (w), 1234 (s), 1189 (s), 963 (s), 800 (m).
