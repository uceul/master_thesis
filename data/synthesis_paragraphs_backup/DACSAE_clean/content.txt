
A mixture of Cu(NO3)2·3H2O (15.0 mg, 62.1 μmol) and the organic ligand H4L1 (5.0 mg, 11.1 μmol) was dissolved in a mixed solvent consisting of N,N′-dimethylformamide (DMF, 1.5 mL), methanol (0.5 mL) and water (0.08 mL) in a 20 mL glass vial. After the addition of 50 μL 6 M HCl, the vial was capped and heated at 353 K for 12 h. After cooling to room temperature, blue rhombus-shaped crystals were isolated by filtration in a yield of 44% based on the organic ligand H4L1. Selected FTIR (kBr, cm−1): 1655, 1591, 1381, 1296, 1254, 1097, 1047, 877, 775, 758, 731, 661, 492; anal. for C34H44Cu2N6O17, calcd: C, 43.64%, H, 4.74%, N, 8.98%; found: C, 43.59%, H, 4.80%, N, 8.75%.
