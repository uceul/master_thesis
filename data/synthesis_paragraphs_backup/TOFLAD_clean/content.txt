{[Cd2(L1)2(btc)(Ac)]·8H2O}n (3): A mixture of Cd(NO3)2·4H2O (0.09 g, 0.3 mmol), L1 (0.04 g, 0.1 mmol), and H3btc (0.042 g, 0.2 mmol) in 8 mL component solvent (N,N‐dimethyl acetamide : deionized water = 3:5) was sealed in a Teflon‐lined autoclave and heated to 150 °C for 4 d. After the autoclave was cooled to room temperature at 10 °C·h–1, pale yellow block crystals were collected by filtration, washed with 3 × 10 mL of methanol, and air‐dried. Yield 13 % based on L1. C51H50N8O16Cd2: calcd. C 48.78; H 4.01; N 8.92 %; found: C 48.86; H 3.92; N 9.07 %.
