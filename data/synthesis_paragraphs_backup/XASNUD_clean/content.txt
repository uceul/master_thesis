Synthesis of [Me2NH2]2[Zn9(μ3‐OH)2(BTC)6(H2O)3]·5DMA·6H2O (FJI‐4): A mixture of Zn(ClO4)2·6H2O (0.10 mmol, 30 mg), H3BTC (0.10 mmol, 20 mg,) in DMA (5 mL) with an additional HBF4 (0.4 mL, HBF4 40 % in water) was sealed in a 23 mL glass vial (the pH of the solution was approximately 4.2), which was heated at 100 °C for 5 d, and cooled down to room temperature. After washing by fresh DMA, the colorless crystals of FJI‐4 were obtained in ca. 65 % yield based on the H3BTC ligand. C54H18O41Zn9: calcd. C 34.8; H 3.46; N 3.85 %. found: C 34.46; H 3.58; N 3.96 %.
