A mixture of L1-H8 (1 mg, 0.91 μmol) and Cu(ClO4)2·6H2O (1.35 mg, 3.65 μmol) was dissolved in a solvent mixture of DEF (0.3 mL), H2O (0.025 mL), and 1 M HCl (10 μL) in a screw-capped vial. The resulting solution was placed in an oven at 80 °C for 2 days. Blue-green crystals (2.2 mg, 69%) with a very thin plate shape were obtained after filtration. Solvent content calculated from the proposed formula: DEF, 58.8%; H2O, 2.0%. Solvent content determined by 1H NMR/TGA: DEF, 58.7%; H2O, 1.9%.
