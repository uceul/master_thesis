‡ Ligand H3tzdc was prepared and purified according to the literature. Synthesis of complex 1: a mixture of NiSO4·6H2O (1.56 g, 6 mmol), H3tzdc (0.72 g, 4.6 mmol), NaOH (0.24 g, 6 mmol) and 90 mL water were sealed in a 150 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel reactor and heated for 3 days at 150 °C. After cooling of the sample for 2 days, green crystals of 1 were obtained in 44% yield (0.620 g, based on Ni). Anal. Calc. for C4H12N3O10Ni1.5: H 3.45; C 13.72; N 12.00; O 45.69. Found: H 3.42; C 13.31; N 11.75; O 44.90%. IR data (KBr, cm−1): 3240(s, br), 2317(w), 1617(vs), 1491(s), 1443(s), 1180(w), 1083(w), 860(m), 675(m).
