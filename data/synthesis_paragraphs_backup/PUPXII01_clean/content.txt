1 mmol MnCl2·4H2O (0.200 g), 0.5 mmol H3PIDC (0.116 g) and 1 mmol KSCN (0.097 g) were mixed and stirred in 6 mL distilled water for 20 min, and then it was transferred to a 25 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel vessel, heated to 160 °C for 3 days. When it was cooled to room temperature, yellow block crystals were obtained, washed by distilled water (Yield: 0.109 g 64.0% based on H3PIDC). Elemental analysis (%): Anal. Calcd. for C 35.31, H 3.26, N 12.35; Found: C 35.28, H 3.34, N 12.29. FT-IR (KBr pellet, cm−1): 3373(s), 1621(s), 1601(s), 1538(m), 1486(m), 1447(m), 1422(m), 1381(s), 1230(w), 1110(w), 1012(w), 864(w), 817(w), 720(w).
