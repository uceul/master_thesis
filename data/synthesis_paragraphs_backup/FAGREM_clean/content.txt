‡ Synthesis of MOF 1: 1,2,4-BTC (0.2 mmol, 42 mg), Zn(NO3)2·6H2O (0.3 mmol, 89 mg), DEF (3 mL), H2O (2 mL) and ethanol (2 mL) were placed in a 23 mL glass vial, which was sealed and heated to 65 °C for 48 h, and then cooled to room temperature. The colorless crystals formed were collected and air-dried (65% based on Zn(NO3)2·6H2O). Elemental analysis (%) calcd for [Zn4(OH)2(1,2,4-btc)2(H2O)2]·0.63DEF·3.5H2O: C 29.11; H 3.00; N 1.01. Found: C, 28.73; H, 3.05; N, 1.22.
