Preparation of Er2(BDC)3(DMF)2(H2O)2·H2O (1). A mixture of Er(NO3)3·5H2O (0.0512 g, 0.115 mmol) and H2BDC (0.0290 g, 0.175 mmol) in a solution containing DMF (3 mL), C2H5OH (3 mL), and H2O (2 mL) in a sealed vial (20 mL) was heated at 80 °C for 24 h. Light-purple crystals of 1 were filtered, dried in air, and collected in ca. 65% yield [on the basis of Er(NO3)3·5H2O]. Anal. Calcd for 1, C30H32Er2N2O17:  C, 35.08; H, 3.14; N, 2.73. Found:  C, 34.90; H, 2.75; N, 2.48. Er2(BDC)3 (1a) was formed by heating compound 1 under vacuum at 140 °C overnight. Anal. Calcd for 1a, C24H12Er2O12:  C, 34.86; H, 1.46. Found:  C, 34.72; H, 1.81.
