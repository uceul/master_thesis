[Tb2(NDC)3(phen)2]·H2NDC (1): Hydrochloric acid (1.65 mol·L−1, 4 drops) was added with stirring to a mixture of dipotassium 2,6‐naphthalenedicarboxylate (0.044 g, 0.15 mmol) and H2O (10 mL). TbCl3·6H2O (0.038 g, 0.1 mmol) and phen·H2O (0.04 g, 0.2 mmol) were then added. The mixture was sealed in a 25‐mL stainless steel reactor equipped with a Teflon liner and heated at 170 °C for 72 h. Light‐yellow crystals of 1 were obtained (0.015 g, 26.0%). C36H21N2O8Tb (768.47): calcd. C 56.27, H 2.75, N 3.65; found C 55.98, H 2.53, N 3.55. IR (KBr pellet):  = 3433 m, 1705 m, 1617 m, 1548 m, 1493 m, 1422 s, 1362 m, 805 m, 792 m, 727 m cm−1.
