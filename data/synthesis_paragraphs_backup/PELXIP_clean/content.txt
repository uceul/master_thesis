
A mixture of CdCl2 (0.092 g, 0.5 mmol), 3-cyanobenzoic acid (0.074 g, 0.5 mmol), NaN3 (0.033 g, 0.5 mmol) and H2O (10 mL) was stirred for 30 min at room temperature and kept in a 23 mL Teflon-lined autoclave at 150 °C for 3 days. The mixtures were cooled to room temperature at 5 °C h−1. Colorless block single crystals of 1 were obtained (yield: 45% based on Cd). Elemental Anal. Calcd (%) for 1, C32H24Cd4N16O12: C, 30.16; H, 1.90; N, 17.59. Found: C, 30.10; H, 1.98; N, 17.50.
