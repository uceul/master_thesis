The iron phosphite, [C4N2H12][Fe4(H2O)3(HPO3)7]·(H2O)x x = 0.6 (1), was synthesized under hydrothermal conditions using ferric chloride hexahydrate as the source of iron. The FeCl3·6H2O (0.270 g, 1 mmol) was dispersed in milli‐Q water (10 mL). H3PO3 (0.492 g, 6 mmol) and piperazine (0.516 g, 6 mmol) were then added and the mixture was homogenized for 30 min at room temperature. The final mixture with the composition 1.0 FeCl3·6H2O/6.0 H3PO3/6.0 Piperazine/555 H2O was heated in a 23‐mL autoclave at 110 °C for 96 h followed by heating at 150 °C for 24 h. The resulting product, containing large quantities of colorless, plate‐like single crystals, was filtered, washed with deionzed water, and dried under ambient conditions. The yield of the product was about 80 % based on Fe. The initial and final pH of the reaction mixture was about 4.
