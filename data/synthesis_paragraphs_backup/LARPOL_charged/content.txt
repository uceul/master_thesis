The mixture of FeCl3 (0.2 mmol, 0.032 g), H3BTC (0.5 mmol, 0.2 g), TMAOH (0.7 mmol, 0.132 g) and DMF (10 mL) was sealed in a Teflon-lined autoclave and heated at 150 °C for 4 days, followed by slow cooling to room temperature. After being washing with DMF several times, 3 was collected as yellow octahedron crystals with a yield of about 91% (based on Fe). Elem. Anal. Calc.: Fe, 17.1; C, 42.6; H, 4.0; N, 28.5. Found: Fe,16.8; C, 42.7; H, 3.9; N, 28.1%.
