The title compound was synthesized hydrothermally under autogenous pressure. In a typical synthesis, a mixture of BeSO4·4H2O (0.179 g), H3PO3 (0.327 g), diethylenetriamine (dien, 0.16 mL), ethylene glycol (3 mL) and H2O (2 mL) in the molar ratio of 1: 4: 1.5: 53: 111 was sealed in a Teflon-lined autoclave and heated at 170 °C for 7 days. After cooling to room temperature, the resulting colorless product was recovered by filtration, washed with distilled water, and dried in air (84.2% yield based on beryllium). CHN elemental analysis confirmed its stoichiometry (Anal. Found: C 10.22, H 4.04, N 9.10%; Calcd: C 10.63, H 4.23, N 9.29%). The X-ray powder diffraction pattern for the resulting product is in good agreement with the simulated pattern on the basis of the crystal structure, indicating the phase purity of the as-synthesized samples of the title compound (Fig. 1).
