
A mixture of CoCl2·6H2O (0.028 g, 0.1 mmol), H2sdba (0.031 g, 0.1 mmol), CH3OH (5 mL) and DMF (5 mL) was placed in a 25 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel container. The mixture was sealed and heated at 160 °C for three days. After the mixture was cooled to ambient temperature at a rate of 5 °C h−1, purple crystals of 1 were obtained with a yield of 63% (based on Co).
