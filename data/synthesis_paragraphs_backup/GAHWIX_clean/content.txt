
A sample of 61.6 mg (0.206 mmol) of Zn(NO3)2·6H2O was added to 5 mL of a DMF solution containing 28.4 mg (0.0457 mmol) of H3L·3H2O. The solution was sealed in a Pyrex tube and heated at 95 °C for 1 d. After cooling to room temperature, colorless block crystals of 1 were filtered and washed with DMF. An activated sample, 1a, was prepared by soaking 1 in fresh DMF for several days, before drying under a dynamic vacuum at 120 °C overnight and then by exposure to air (yield: 33 mg, 83%). Elemental analysis: calc. for [(Zn4O)2(C30H18N3O9)4(C3H7NO)2(H2O)3]·25H2O (1a): C, 43.69; H, 4.13; N, 5.66. Found: C, 43.52; H, 3.71; N, 5.71%. IR (KBr, cm−1): 3286 (m), 3080 (m), 2996 (m), 1660 (s), 1605 (vs), 1563 (m), 1525 (vs), 1403 (s), 1316 (m), 1253 (s), 1178 (w), 1107 (w), 1014 (w), 956 (w), 861 (w), 782 (w), 732 (w), 698 (w).
