
A mixture of La(NO3)3·6H2O (12 mg), Qu-H3L (6 mg) and DMF/methanol/H2O = 4:2:0.5 (1 mL) was stirred for ca. 20 min in air, then transferred and sealed in a 4 ml Teflon-lined autoclave, which was heated at 80 °C for 48 h. After cooling to room temperature, colorless crystals were obtained. Yield: 39% (based on the ligand). Elemental analysis calcd. (%) for [C27H19LaO8]: C, 53.13; H, 3.14; found: C, 52.82; H, 3.31.
