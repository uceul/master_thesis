
H3TPO (40.0 mg, 0.1 mmol) and UO2(NO3)3·6H2O (50.2 mg, 0.1 mmol) were dissolved in a mixture of 3 mL DMF and 2 mL H2O. The resulting solution was sealed in a 20 mL glass vial and heated at 90 °C for 3 days. The reaction system was cooled slowly to room temperature. After filtration and washing with DMF and ethanol, light yellow plate like crystals suitable for X-ray structural analysis were collected. Yield: ca. 48.5% (based on UO2(NO3)2·6H2O). Anal. Calcd for C35H72O25N5PU: C, 34.09; H, 5.97; N, 5.69; Found: C, 33.77; H, 4.68; N, 5.70.
