The title compound was synthesized by hydrothermal method under autogenous pressure. In a typical synthesis, a mixture of ZnO (0.25 g), H3PO4 (0.43 ml, 85 wt.%), 1-(2-aminoethyl)piperazine (0.32 ml) and H2O (4 ml) in a molar ratio of 1:2:0.8:73 was stirred under ambient conditions. The resulting gel, with a pH of ∼3, was sealed in a Teflon-lined steel autoclave and heated at 168 °C for 4 days. The product, consisting of single crystals in the form of colorless prisms (Fig. 1), was recovered by filtration, washed with distilled water and dried in air (76% yield based on ZnO).
