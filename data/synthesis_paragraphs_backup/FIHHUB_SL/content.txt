
The synthetic procedure was similar to that of MOF 1. A mixture of L (12 mg, 0.029 mmol), H2bdc (4.8 mg, 0.029 mmol), Cd(NO3)2·4H2O (16 mg, 0.054 mmol), DMF (2 mL) and an aliquot of HNO3 in EtOH (0.5 mL of a 0.03 M solution) was sealed in the autoclave at 85 °C for 2 days and then cooled to room temperature. Black hexagonal crystals of 2 were collected in a ca. 15% yield based on Cd2+. The phase purity was confirmed by powder X-ray diffraction (Fig. S3 and S4 in the ESI). The formula was estimated as [CdL(bdc)]·1.5DMF·H2O based on the single crystal structure analysis and IR, elemental and thermogravimetric analysis data.
