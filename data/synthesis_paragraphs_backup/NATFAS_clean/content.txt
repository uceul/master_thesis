
The reaction mixture containing Zn(OAc)2·2H2O (0.0438 g, 0.2 mmol), H4BTC (0.05 g, 0.2 mmol), water (1 mL), DMF (2 mL), and ethanol (2 mL) was sealed in a 25 mL Teflon reactor autoclave and heated to 85 °C for 3 days. After cooling down to room temperature, the resulting single crystals of 1 were collected and washed with water, and then dried in air (31.54 mg, 40% yield based on H4BTC). Anal. Calcd (%) for C24H20 N2O16Zn3: C 36.55, H 2.56, N 3.55%. Found: C 36.30, H 2.50, N 3.52%.
