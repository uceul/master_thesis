
A mixture of the organic linker H4L2 (5.0 mg, 10.93 μmol) and CuCl2·2H2O (10.0 mg, 58.66 μmol) was dissolved in a mixed solvent of DMF, acetonitrile and H2O (1.5 mL/0.5 mL/0.08 mL) in a screw-capped vial (20 mL). After 50 μL of 6 M HCl were added, the vial was capped and heated at 353 K for 72 h. Blue rhombic crystals were obtained in 53% yield. ZJNU-44 can be best formulated as [Cu2L2(H2O)2]·3DMF·3CH3CN·3H2O on the basis of single-crystal X-ray diffraction structure determination, TGA and microanalysis. Selected FTIR (KBr, cm−1): 1655, 1570, 1439, 1413, 1373, 1306, 1254, 1099, 1053, 777, 756, 731, 694, 661, 492; anal. for C40H51Cu2N7O16, calcd: C 47.43%, H 5.07%, N 9.68%; found: C 47.39%, H 5.15%, N 9.54%.
