Synthesis of [La(BTB)H2O]·Guest (1·Guest): La(NO3)3·6H2O (17.6 mg, 0.040 mmol) and 1,3,5‐tris(4‐carboxyphenyl)benzene (H3BTB, 6 mg, 0.0136 mmol) were mixed with 2 mL of DMF/MeOH/H2O (3:3:0.5) in a glass container and tightly capped with a Teflon vial and heated at 80 °C for two days. After cooling to room temperature, colourless needle crystals were obtained. Yield: 63% (based on the ligand).
