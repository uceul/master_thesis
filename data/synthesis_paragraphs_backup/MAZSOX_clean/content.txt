Synthesis of Zn3(btz)2(bdc)2⋅x(DMA) (1): A mixture of Zn(NO3)2⋅6H2O (0.1600 g, 0.55 mmol), pyrazine (0.0150 g, 0.19 mmol), 1H‐benzotriazole (0.0800 g, 0.67 mmol), 1,4‐benzenedicarboxylic acid (0.1000 g, 0.60 mmol), methanol (2.5 mL), and N,N‐dimethylacetamide (7.5 mL) in a 23 mL Teflon‐lined stainless steel vessel was heated at 120 °C for 5 days, and then cooled to room temperature. Colorless transparent crystals were thus obtained (70 % yield based on zinc).
