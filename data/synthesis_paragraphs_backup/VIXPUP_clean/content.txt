H4BDPO (10.4 mg, 0.025 mmol), Cu(NO3)2·3H2O (25 mg, 0.1 mmol), DMF (2 mL), ethanol (1.6 mL), H2O (1.6 mL), and concentrated HNO3 (400 μL) were mixed and stirred for a few minutes in air and then the clear solution was transferred into a autoclave Teflon-line stainless vessel (20 mL). The vessel was sealed and heated at 75 °C for 2 days and then cooled to room temperature. Pale-blue block crystals of HNUST-3 were obtained and then washed by DMF to yield about 10.0 mg (yield: ∼70% based on the ligand). The crystals of HNUST-3 are stable for common organic solvents except for water, and it becomes opaque after exposure for several minutes in air. Satisfactory elemental analysis data could not be obtained, despite several attempts. This could be attributed to the fact that the extent of the solvent molecules in the cavity may vary from the exposure time of the sample to air. Selected IR (KBr, cm–1): 1654, 1586, 1374, 1413, 1253, 1174, 1105, 776, 730.
