[{Cd4(bpa)4(bpy)6}·(bpy)0.5·7H2O]n (3): Similar to the synthesis of 1, the hydrothermal reaction of cadmium acetate dihydrate (1.5 mmol), H2bpa (1 mmol), bpy·2H2O (1 mmol), NaOC2H5 (4 mmol) and H2O (5 mL) in a molar ratio of 3:2:2:8:556 was performed at 200 °C for 4 days, then the reactant was cooled to a rate of about 3.5 °C·h−1. The resulting primrose needle crystals were separated by hand from the reaction mixture and washed with water and absolute alcohol to give about a 39% yield of 1 (373.0 mg) based on Cd. C121H98Cd4N13O23 (2551.7): calcd. C 56.95, H 3.87, N 7.14, O 14.42; found C 56.92, H 2.97, N 7.17, O 14.18. FT‐IR (KBr pellet):  = 3390 cm−1 (s), 3082 (w), 3055 (w), 1942 (w), 1585 (s), 1539 (s), 1489 (m), 1385 (s), 1219 (s), 1176 (w), 1105 (w), 1074 (m), 1043 (w), 1005 (s), 833 (s), 806 (s), 775 (s), 764 (s), 729 (w), 702 (w), 677 (m), 629(s), 567 (w), 492 (m).
