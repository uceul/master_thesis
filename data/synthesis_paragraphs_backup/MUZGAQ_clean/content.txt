A mixture of Dy2O3 (189 mg, 0.507 mmol), Zn(OAC)2 (30 mg, 0.229 mmol), isonicotinic acid (247 mg, 1.945 mmol), HCOOH (29 mg, 0.630 mmol), and H2O (8 mL) was stirred for 12 h in the air until all reagents dissolve, and then the pH of the solution was adjusted to 2 with HCl (36−38%). Finally, this solution was sealed in a 25 mL Teflon-lined autoclave and kept at 170 °C for seven days. Light-yellow block crystals of 1 were obtained (112 mg, yield of 30% based on Dy), which were washed with deionized water and dried at room temperature for 24 h. IR (cm−1): 3612 (s), 3409 (s), 1800(w), 1602(vs), 1550(vs), 1420(vs), 1222(w), 1060(w), 1003(w), 833(w), 771(s), 711(s), 680(s). Elemental analysis calc.: C, 22.42, H, 2.20, N, 3.69%; found: C, 22.50, H, 2.25, N, 3.74%.
