
A mixture of tmtz (0.3 mmol), CuCl2·2H2O (0.3 mmol) and NaH2sip (0.2 mmol) was dissolved in CH3OH (5 mL) and H2O (10 mL), and then the pH was adjusted to 6 by the addition of 1 mol L−1 NaOH. The resulting mixture was sealed in a 25 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel vessel and heated at 130 °C for 24 h, and then cooled to room temperature. Blue crystals were obtained in 72% yield (based on Cu). Anal. Calc. for C64H82Cu3N18O22S2 (1): C, 44.95; H, 4.83; N, 14.75; Cu, 3.72. Found: C, 44.98; H, 4.79; N, 14.72; Cu, 3.68%.
