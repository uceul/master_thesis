A 0.02 M stock solution of copper nitrate trihydrate in DEF (0.5 mL) was added to a 8 mL vial, which was preloaded with H6CPB (20 mg, 0.025 mmol). This was followed by the addition of deionized water (3 mL) to the mixture, which was then heated at 85 °C for 16 h to yield blue, block-shaped crystals. The crystals were then thoroughly washed with DMF (3 × 10 mL) per day for 3 days total. To yield guest-free material, DMF-washed MOF-891 was immersed in MeOH (3 × 10 mL) per day over a total of 4 days. The solvent-exchanged sample was activated under vacuum at ambient temperature for 24 h, followed by heating at 180 °C under vacuum for an additional 24 h. EA.
