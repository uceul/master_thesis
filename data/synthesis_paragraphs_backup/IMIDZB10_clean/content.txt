350 mg of Zn(NO3)2·6H2O and 200 mg of 2-methylimidazole were placed in a 20 mL screw-top vial and dissolved in 15 mL of DMF. Three drops of HNO3 were added to a mixture with a Pasteur pipet, and complete dissolution was achieved by sonication. The vial was capped and placed in an oven at 120 °C for 24 h. ZIF-8 crystals were collected and washed with DMF. The crystals were stored in DMF until needed for experiments.
