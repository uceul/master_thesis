Synthesis of 2: Scandium trichloride hydrate (0.027 g, 0.135 mmol) and H3L (0.020 g, 0.045 mmol) were mixed and dispersed in a mixture of dimethylformamide (3.0 mL), tetrahydrofuran (4.0 mL), dichloromethane (3.0 mL), water (3.0 mL) and concentrated nitric acid (68 %, 3 drops). The reaction mixture was sealed and heated in a pressure tube to 120 °C for 48 h. The tube was cooled to room temperature over a period of 12 h. The colourless crystalline product was separated by filtration, washed with DMF (5.00 mL) and dried briefly in air (71 % yield based on the ligand). Elemental analytical data corresponds to {[Sc3O(L)2(H2O)3]OH(H2O)5(DMF)}∞: elemental analysis calcd (%) for Mr=1254.88: C 54.51; H 4.33; N 1.12; found: C 54.87; H 4.78; N 1.15 %.
