
A mixture of MnCl2·4H2O (0.0396 g, 0.2 mmol), H3ABTC (0.0157 g, 0.05 mmol), NaOH aqueous solution (0.5 mL, 1 M) and distilled water (10 mL) was sealed in a 20 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel vessel, and heated at 65 °C for two days. After the autoclave was cooled over a period of 7 h at a rate of 5 °C h−1, orange block-shaped crystals of 3 were collected, washed with distilled water, and dried in air. Yield: 13.3 mg, 20% based on Mn. Anal. calcd for C30H41N4O25.5Mn3: C, 34.97; H, 4.01; N, 5.44%. Found: C, 35.07; H, 4.02; N, 5.45%. IR data (KBr, cm−1): 3399(s), 1636(m), 1610(w), 1576(w), 1543(w), 1378(s), 1109(w), 790(w), 709(s).
