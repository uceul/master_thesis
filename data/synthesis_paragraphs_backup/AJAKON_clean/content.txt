
A mixture of H3TCA (0.05 mol), Cd(NO3)2·4H2O (0.25 mmol)) and HBF4 (40% aqueous, 2 drops) in the DMA/EtOH/H2O mixed solvent (DMA 2 mL; EtOH 1 mL; H2O 1 mL) was fully stirred at room temperature for 30 min, sealed in a 25 mL Teflon-lined autoclave and heated at 100 °C for 40 h. The autoclave was slowly cooled (5 °C h−1) to ambient temperature. The resultant yellow crystals were isolated, and dried in air (67.8% yield based on H3TCA).
