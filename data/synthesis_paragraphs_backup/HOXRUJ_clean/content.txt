{[KEu(pztc)(H2O)2]·H2O}n (1): A mixture of K4pztc (0.0825g, 0.2 mmol), Eu2O3 (0.0530g, 0.15 mmol), HCl (3 mol·L–1, 0.5 mL), and water (10 mL) was sealed in a 25 mL Teflon‐lined stainless steel vessel. The vessel was heated at 120 °C for 48 h, cooled with 2 °C h–1 to 100 °C, and finally cooled with 1 °C h–1 to room temperature. The colorless crystals were obtained in 56 % yield based on EuIII. C8H6EuKN2O11: calcd. C 19.33, H 1.21, N 5.63 %; found: C 19.39, H 1.27, N 5.72 %. FT‐IR (KBr):  = 3106 m, 1625 vs, 1465 s, 1419 m, 1335 s, 1312 s, 1035 w, 885 m, 844 m, 642 m cm–1.
