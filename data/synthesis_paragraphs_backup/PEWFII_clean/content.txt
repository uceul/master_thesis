(UO2)Cu(H2O)2(btec)⋅4 H2O (2): A mixture of UO2(NO3)2⋅6 H2O (250 mg, 0.5 mmol), copper metal (31 mg, 0.5 mmol), pyromellitic acid (150 mg, 0.59 mmol), and water (5 mL, 277 mmol) was placed in a Parr bomb and then heated statically at 150 °C for 24 h. The pH value of the solution was 1 at the end of the reaction. The resulting green product was then filtered off, washed with water, and dried at RT. Compound 2 was analyzed by SEM and showed typical elongated crystals of size 20–50 μm (see the Supporting Information, S1).
