
A mixture of Eu(NO3)3·6H2O (0.0223 g, 0.05 mmol) and H4L (0.0255 g, 0.05 mmol) in 6 mL of DMF and three drops of HCl (6 mol L−1) was sealed in an autoclave equipped with a Teflon liner (25 mL), heated at 100 °C for 2 days, and then cooled to room temperature. Colourless block single crystals of 2 were collected in a ca. 34% yield based on H4L. The phase purity was confirmed by powder X-ray diffraction (Fig. S2 in ESI).
