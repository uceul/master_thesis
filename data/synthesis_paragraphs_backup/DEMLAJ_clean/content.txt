Preparation of Complex 1: A mixture of Cu(NO3)2·3H2O (0.241 g, 1.0 mmol), NaN3 (0.065 g, 1.0 mmol), 2, 2′‐bipyridine (0.156 g, 1.0 mmol), and acetonitrile (5.0 mL) was stirred for 10 min in air, and then transferred and sealed in a 15‐mL Teflon‐lined reactor. The reactor was heated in an oven to 140 °C for 72 h and then cooled to room temperature at a rate of 5 °C h–1. The pale‐yellow block crystal was attained in a reasonable yield (35.5 %, 0.053 g) based on Cu(NO3)2·3H2O. C20H34Cu10N40O2 (1502.27): calcd. H 2.28, C 15.99, N 37.29; found H 2.31, C15.90, N 37.34. IR data (KBr): 2921 (m), 1634 (m), 1499 (s), 1384 (s), 1135 (m), 1045 (m), 698 (w) cm–1.
