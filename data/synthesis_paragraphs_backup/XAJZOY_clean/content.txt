AlPO-ERI was synthesized under hydrothermal conditions in the presence of TMHDA as template. Aluminum isopropoxide Al(OiPr)3 (98+%, Aldrich) and phosphoric acid (85 wt.% in water, Prolabo) were used as aluminum and phosphorus sources, respectively. Typically, 14.7 g of aluminum isopropoxide were dispersed in 30 ml of water and the suspension was stirred for 2 h. Then 4.92 ml of H3PO4 were added dropwise and the obtained gel was stirred for an additional hour. Finally, 7.75 ml of diamine were slowly added and stirring was maintained for an additional 2 h. The resulting gel, with the composition Al2O3–P2O5–TMHDA–46 H2O was transferred into a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave and heated at 200 °C for 60 h. The solid, recovered by filtration, appeared in the form of elongated hexagonal prisms. It was washed with distilled water and air-dried at room temperature. Part of the crystals was calcined in air at 500 °C for 24 h. After cooling down the temperature, the calcined AlPO-ERI was rehydrated under ambient atmosphere for 15 days.
