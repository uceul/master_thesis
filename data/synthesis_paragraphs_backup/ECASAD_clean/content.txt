All chemicals and solvents used in the syntheses were of reagent grade and used as purchased from Beijing without further purification. Compound 1 were prepared from a mixture of 5ZnO·2CO2·4H2O (0.567 g, 1 mmol), H3PO4 (0.34 ml, 5 mmol), 4,4′-bipy (0.960 g, 5 mmol), and distilled water (10 mL) with a molar composition of 1:5:5:555. The mixture was sealed in a 23 mL capacity of Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave under autogenous pressure, and heated at 160 °C for 120 h. After cooling colorless crystals for single crystal X-ray diffraction (XRD) were obtained. The yield was 85%, based on Zn. The pH of the reaction mixture before hydrothermal reaction was 2.1. Attempts to synthesize the arsenate analogue under similar reaction were failed.
