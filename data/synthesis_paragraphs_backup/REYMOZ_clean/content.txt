PMo11V@HKUST-1 ([(CH3)4N]4[PMo11VO40][Cu2(C6H3O6)4/3]6, CCDC is 909625) was prepared by the hydrothermal method. 2.4 g of Cu(NO3)2·3H2O (10 mmol) and 2 g of H4[PMo11VO40]·xH2O (PMo11V) were added into 100 mL distilled water and stirred vigorously for 10 min. Then 2.1 g of BTC (10 mmol) and 3.6 g of (CH3)4NOH·5H2O (20 mmol) were added with continued stirring for another 10 min. The turbid mixture was then transferred into a 200 mL Teflon-lined autoclave at 180 °C for 24 h. The autoclave was then cooled to room temperature and dark green crystals can be collected. IR spectra (Fig. S1) and XRD spectra (Fig. S2) were performed to characterize the crystals. Yield: 87.6% (based on Cu).
