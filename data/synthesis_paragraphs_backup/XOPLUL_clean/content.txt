
The compound 2 was synthesized using Cd(NO3)2·4H2O (0.0616 gm, 0.2 mmol) in water (2.5 mL) and 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid (0.0312 g, 0.2 mmol) in DMF (7.5 mL) in a glass vial. The mixture was sonicated for 5 minutes and the reaction mixture was heated at 100 °C for 2 days. Then it was cooled to room temperature. The colourless block-type crystals were formed. Crystals were washed several times to remove the crystalized ligand. Yield was 75% based on the metal.
