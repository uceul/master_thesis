A mixture of Co(NO3)2·6H2O (0.1 mmol), H4btec (0.1 mmol), imb (0.2 mmol), DMF (1 mL), N(Et)3 (0.1 mL) and distilled water (8 mL) was sealed in a 25 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel container and heated at 100 °C for 72 hours. After the mixture cooled to room temperature at a rate of 5 °C/h, red crystals of {[Co(btec)0.5(imb)(H2O)]∙1.5H2O}n suitable for X-ray analysis were collected. Anal Calcd for C32H32Co2N8O13: C 44.98, H 3.77, N 13.11%. Found: C 45.23, H 3.54, N 13.42%. IR (KBr, cm− 1): 3412(m), 3146(w), 1662(w), 1569(s), 1490(m), 1436(m), 1386(s), 1280(m), 1104(s), 943(m), 871(m), 749(s).
