Single crystals of compound 1‐Tb were obtained through the solvothermal reaction of Tb(NO3)2⋅6 H2O (250 mg) and H4L (55 mg) in N,N‐dimethylformamide (DMF) (3 mL) with HNO3 (0.45 mL; 63 %, aq.) at 105 °C for 72 h. The mixture was then cooled to room temperature. Crystals were obtained and air‐dried (yield 25 %, based on Tb). Elemental analysis (%) calcd for 1‐Tb {[Ln3L2(OH) (DMF)0.22(H2O)5.78]⋅H2O⋅DMF}: C 33.08, H 2.50, N 6.59; found: C 33.29, H 2.60, N 5.50. The same synthetic method was used for 1‐Eu except that Eu(NO3)2⋅6 H2O was used instead of Tb(NO3)2⋅6 H2O (yield 55 %, based on Eu). The experimental PXRD pattern of 1‐Eu was in good agreement with the simulated one based on the single‐crystal X‐ray data for 1‐Tb, indicating isomorphism and phase purity (Figure S8 a). The PXRD pattern for activated 1‐Eu was a less perfect match (Figure S8 a), suggesting some decomposition and/or structural changes upon desolvation; similar changes were observed upon sorption of metal ions and Cr2O72− anions (Figure S8).
