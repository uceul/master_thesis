Preparation of [In2(btc)2(μ-OH)2]n·2nHpy (1). An aqueous mixture (4.0 mL) containing InCl3 (26.0 mg, 0.12 mmol), H3btc (50.0 mg, 0.24 mmol), and pyridine (1.0 mL, 12.40 mmol) with the pH value around 6−7 was placed in a 30-mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave, and the autoclave was sealed, heated to 160 °C under autogenous pressure for 85 h, and then cooled to room temperature at a rate of 6 °C/h. Light yellow crystalline product was filtered, washed with N,N-dimethylformamide, distilled water, and dried at ambient temperature to give 39 mg of complex 1 (yield 78% based on InCl3). Complex 1 is stable, and insoluble in water and most organic solvents. Anal. Calcd for C28N2O14In2H20:  C, 40.13; H, 2.41; N, 3.34%. Found:  C, 39.66; H, 2.36; N, 3.40%.
