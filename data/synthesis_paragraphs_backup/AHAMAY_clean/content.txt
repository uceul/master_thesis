[enH2]0.5Zn[(L)(H2O)]·H2O (1): A mixture of Zn(NO3)2·6H2O (0.30 g, 1.0 mmol), NaF (0.04g, 1.0 mmol), and H3L (0.5 mL, 2.0 mmol) in deionised water (10.0 mL), adjusted to pH ≈︁ 6 with ethylenediamine whilst stirring, was sealed in a 23 mL Teflon‐lined stainless steel autoclave, and then heated at 160 °C for 3 days. After the mixture was slowly cooled to room temperature, colourless block crystals were filtered off, washed with distilled water, and dried at room temperature (Yield: ca. 38 % based on zinc). Compound 1 (C3H11NO8PZn): calcd. C 12.62; H 3.88; N 4.91; P 10.85 %; Zn 22.91; found: C 12.68; H 3.82; N 4.97; P 10.81; Zn 22.85 %.
