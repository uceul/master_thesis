All starting reagents were commercially available and used as received without further purification. Pyridine-2,4,6-tricarboxylic acid was synthesized by the oxidation of 2,4,6-trimethylpyridine by KMnO4 in aqueous solution according to the literature method [9]. Cd(NO3)2 · 4H2O (93 mg, 0.3 mmol) was added to a stirring solution of pyridine-2,4,6-tricarboxylic acid (63 mg, 0.3 mmol) dissolved in C2H5OH (10 mL). After stirring for 3 h at room temperature to attain homogeneity, the mixture was sealed in Teflon-lined stainless vial, which was heated at 165 °C under solvothermal condition for 7 days. When the solution was cooled to room temperature after 30 h, colorless crystals suitable for X-ray data collection were obtained. The crystals were washed three times with 10 mL C2H5OH and dried in air. Yield: 16% (based on Cd). IR (Al2O3, cm−1): υ = 3631 m (H2O), 1600s, 1472s (C
