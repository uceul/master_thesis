Compound 1 was prepared hydrothermally from a mixture of V2O5/H3PO3/Bipy/H2O with a molar ratio of 1/16/1/531. Typically, 0.023 g V2O5, 0.2 mL H3PO3 and 0.025 g Bipy were dissolved in 0.1 mL NH3 · H2O and 2 mL distilled water with stirring to form a homogeneous mixture with pH 2.0, then sealed in a 20 mL glass vial and heated under autogenous pressure at 80 °C for 12 h, then cooled to room temperature. Green crystals of compound 1 were collected (66% yield based on V2O5) and air-dried for characterization.
