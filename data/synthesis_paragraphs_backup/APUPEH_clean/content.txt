
Cu(NO3)2·3H2O (7.2 mg, 0.030 mmol) and (S)-1H2 (9.0 mg, 0.030 mmol) in a solvent mixture of DEF/MeOH (1.5/1.5 mL) were placed in a 4 mL vial. N,N′-dimethylaniline (1 mL) was placed in a 20 mL vial. The 4 mL vial was placed in the center of the 20 mL vial, which was capped tightly. The system was heated at 65 °C for 1 day, blue cubic crystals were obtained in 35% yield based on the used ligand. The blue crystals in dark blue solution were rinsed with a solvent mixture of DEF/MeOH (3/3 mL) three times. Elementary analysis: (%) As the free guest molecules were evaporated before the conduction of the elemental analysis. calcd. for (S)-KUMOF-1 [Cu2((S)-1)2]·(H2O)2 = C32H28O14Cu2: C, 50.33; H, 3.70; found: C, 50.38; H, 3.75.
