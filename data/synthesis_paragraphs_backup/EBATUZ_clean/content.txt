A mixture of H4bdfdpa (0.0024 g, 0.005 mmol), CuI (0.010 g, 0.05 mmol), HBF4 (100 μL), and DMF (1 mL) was sealed in a 20 mL vial and ultrasonically treated for 3 min at room temperature until it changed to a clear solution, then kept in an oven at 85 °C for 24 h, and cooled to room temperature. The green block crystals were collected, washed with DMF, and air-dried (76% yield based on CuI). Anal. Calcd for Cu2C50H66O19N8: C 48.79; H 4.67; N 0.46%; found: C 46.73; H 3.33; N 0.50%.
