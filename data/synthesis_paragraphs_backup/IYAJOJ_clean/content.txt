The autoclave was subsequently cooled to room temperature. Colourless crystals were recovered by filtration, washed with DMA and ethanol, and finally dried at ambient temperature (35.6% yield based on H2BDC). CHN elemental analysis: anal. for 2: C 41.89 wt%, H 3.24 wt%, and N 2.64 wt%; calc. for 2: C 41.97 wt%, H 3.13 wt%, and N 2.72 wt%. IR (KBr, cm−1): 3422 (m), 1564 (s), 1502 (m), 1483 (m), 1396 (s), 1294 (m), 1148 (w), 1093 (m), 1015 (m), 948 (m), 833 (m), 746 (m), 520 (m).
