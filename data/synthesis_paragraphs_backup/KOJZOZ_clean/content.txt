 Equimolar amounts of H2IBPDC (0.022 g, 0.042 mmol) and Cu(NO3)2·2.5H2O (0.010 g, 0.043 mmol) in a solvent mixture of DMF/EtOH/pyridine (1.5:0.5:0.07 mL) were placed in a glass tube (10 mm diameter and 140 mm length). The tube was sealed under vacuum and heated at 85 °C for 20 h. The blue block-shaped crystals were washed with 3 × 2 mL of DMF and 2 × 1 mL of cyclohexane (yield: 24 mg, 76% based on H2IBPDC). Anal. Calcd for C42.33H39.67N3.67O12.67Cu2I4 = Cu2(IBPDC)2(DMF)2(H2O)2.67(Py)1.67: C, 35.38; H, 2.78; N, 3.57%. Found: C, 35.16; H, 2.70; N, 3.38%. FT-IR: (KBr, 3500 − 400 cm−1): 3440 (br), 3063 (w), 2926 (w), 2861 (sh), 1662 (s), 1622 (s), 1541 (m), 1396 (s), 1250 (w), 1103 (w), 1037 (w), 1001 (w), 853 (w), 782 (s), 708 (m), 660 (w), 475 (w). For porosity measurements, as-synthesized MOF-603 was rinsed with DMF and immersed in THF for a week, during which the activation solvent was decanted and freshly replenished three times. The solvent was removed under vacuum at room temperature, yielding porous material.
