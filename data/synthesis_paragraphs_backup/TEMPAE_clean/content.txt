Amounts of 594 mg of [Zn(NO3)2] · 6H2O (2 mmol) and 152 mg of H2Me4BPDC (0.5 mmol) were dissolved in 10 mL of DMF inside a 25 mL vial sealed with a Teflon lined screw cap. The solution was heated for 2 days at 80 °C which resulted in deposition of large (up to ∼1 mm) cubic crystals after cooling. The supernatant solution was removed by suction under inert gas, rinsed a few times with MeOH and dried in vacuum at 10 Torr. Yield: 195 mg (64 %) of slightly yellow crystals. FT-IR (neat), νmax/cm−1: ∼3300 (w, vbr), 2919 (w), 2861 (w), 1666 (m), 1601 (s), 1559 (s), 1423 (s), 1395 (s), 1371 (s), 1266 (m), 1095 (w), 1003 (w), 907 (w), 789 (s), 760 (s), 663 (vw), 628 (vw).
