Zn(NO3)2.6H2O (0.165 g, 0.555 mmol), H2bdc (0.138 g, 0.833 mmol), bimx (0.082 g, 0.278 mmol), and distilled water (4 mL, 222 mmol) were mixed to yield a suspension with a pH value of 4. The suspension was charged into an autoclave (degree of filling 50 %) and treated hydrothermally under autogeneous pressure and static conditions at 150Â° C for 43 h. Pale yellow crystals of 2 were separated by filtration, washed with DMF and water and dried. The yield was 0.141 g (85 % based on Zn). Elemental analysis for C21H18N2O6Zn: C 55.02, H 4.13, N 5.86 (calc: C 54.86, H 3.95, N 6.09). Experimental and simulated powder XRD patterns and an IR spectrum are presented in the Supporting Information.
