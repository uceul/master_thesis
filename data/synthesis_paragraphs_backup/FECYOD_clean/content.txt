SUMOF-2, which is related to an interpenetrated analogue of MOF-5, was synthesized by first dissolving Zn(NO3)2·6H2O (600 mg, 2 mmol; Sigma-Aldrich, CAS number 10196-18-6) and benzene-1,4-dicarboxylic acid (H2BDC, 170 mg, 1 mmol; Aldrich, CAS number 100-21-0) in 20 mL of DMF (VWR, CAS number 68-12-2). The solution was solvothermally treated in a 30 mL Teflon-lined autoclave at 120 °C for 24 h, under static conditions. Colorless cubic crystals formed (yield ≈ 300 mg), which were filtered, washed with DMF, and dried at room temperature. The chemical formula of activated SUMOF-2 is [Zn4O(BDC)3]·(ZnO)0.125 as deduced from the structure refinement and the elemental analysis (wt%): exp: C 36.61, H 1.742, N 0.034; calcd: C 36.96, H 1.529, N 0.
