Synthesis of 1. Co(NO3)2·6H2O (0.058 g, 0.2 mmol), tpt (0.031 g, 0.1 mmol) and H2bpdc (0.024 g, 0.1 mmol) were added in the solvent mixture of N,N-dimethylacetamide (DMA, 5 mL)/methanol (CH3OH, 5 mL) solvent in a 20 mL screw-capped vial, then 100 μL HBF4 (Tetrafluoroboric acid, 40% in water) was added into the solution and the mixture was sonicated for 30 min. Finally, the mixture was sealed and heated to 120 °C for 3 days. The large red octahedral crystals of 1 were filtered and washed with DMA and CH3OH. (Yield: 65% based on Co).
