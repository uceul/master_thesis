Zn3(BDC)2(HBDC)2·2DMA (1): A mixture of Zn(OAc)2·2H2O (82 mg), 9‐AC (55 mg), H2BDC (42 mg), methanol (1 mL), and DMA (4 mL) was sealed in a 25 mL, Teflon®‐lined, stainless‐steel autoclave and heated at 150 °C for 4 d. The autoclave was subsequently cooled to room temperature. Colorless crystals were recovered by filtration, which were washed with DMA and ethanol and finally dried at ambient temperature (16.8 % yield based on H2BDC).
