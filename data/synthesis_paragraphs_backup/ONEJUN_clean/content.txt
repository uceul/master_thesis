[CuII(2,2′-bipy)2(H2O)]3[CuI6(pz)6(P2W18O62)2] (1). A mixture of K6P2W18O62·15H2O (0.30 g, 0.06 mmol), CuCl2·2H2O (0.17 g, 0.99 mmol), pz (0.07 g, 0.87 mmol), 2,2′-bipy (0.02 g, 0.13 mmol) and H2O (10 mL) was stirred for an hour. The pH was adjusted to 2.8 with 2 M HCl, then sealed in an 18 mL Teflon-lined reactor and heated at 160 °C for 3 days. Black block crystals were filtered, washed with water and dried at room temperature (yield 62%, based on W). Calc. for C84H78Cu9N24O127P4W36 (10769.65): C, 9.37; H, 0.73; N, 3.12. Found: C, 9.26; H, 0.89; N, 3.15%. IR (solid KBr pellet, cm−1): 3445 (m), 1626 (w), 1479 (w), 1424 (s), 1161 (m), 1088 (s), 966 (w), 917(w), 789 (s).
