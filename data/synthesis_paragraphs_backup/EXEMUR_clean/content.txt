A mixture of H2(pc1)Cl2·2H2O (50.5 mg, 0.1 mmol), cadmium chloride (CdCl2; 128.4 mg, 0.7 mmol), dimethylformamide (1.5 mL), dioxane (1.5 mL), and H2O (0.3 mL) was heated at 100 °C for 48 h in a 25 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave. Then the mixture was slowly cooled to room temperature at a rate of 2 °C/h. Crystals suitable for X-ray analyses were collected, washed with ethyl acetate, and air-dried: [Cd4(pc1)3Cl6]·CdCl4·8H2O (1) of 60% yield based on H2(pc1)Cl2·2H2O. Anal. Calcd for Cd5Cl10C72H64N6O20 (2249.79): C, 38.43; H, 2.86; N, 3.73. Found: C, 37.90; H, 2.62; N, 3.95.
