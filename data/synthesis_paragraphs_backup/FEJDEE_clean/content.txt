Synthesis of [H3N(CH2)4NH3]·[Zn3(HPO3)4]·H2O, 1. In a typical synthesis for compound 1, a mixture of ZnO (0.113 g), H3PO3 (0.55 mL, 50 wt %), 1,4-diaminobutane (0.14 mL), and H2O (2.5 mL) in a molar ratio of 1:3:1:100 was stirred under ambient conditions until it was homogeneous. The resulting gel was loaded into a Teflon-lined steel autoclave and heated at 120 °C for 4 days followed by slow cooling to room temperature. The solid product, consisting of colorless prismatic single crystals, was filtered, washed with distilled water, and dried in air (87% yield based on Zn). The purity of the as-prepared sample was checked by comparing its experimental and simulated XRD patterns. The diffraction peaks on both  patterns corresponded well in position (Figure 1a), indicating the purity of the as-synthesized sample. The intensitiy difference between the simulated and experimental patterns is believed to be caused by preferred orientation of the powder sample during collection of the experimental XRD data. And the ICP and elemental analysis results were also in good agreement with the expected values based on the single-crystal structure analysis.
