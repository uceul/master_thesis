
A mixture of the organic linker H4L3 (5.0 mg, 10.91 μmol) and Cu(NO3)2·3H2O (15.0 mg, 62.10 μmol) was dissolved in a mixed solvent of DMF, methanol and H2O (1.5 mL/0.5 mL/0.08 mL) in a screw-capped vial (20 mL). 50 μL of 6 M HCl were then added. The vial was capped and heated at 363 K for 48 h. Blue rhombic crystals were obtained in 60% yield. ZJNU-45 can be best formulated as [Cu2L3(H2O)2]·3DMF·3MeOH·3H2O on the basis of single-crystal X-ray diffraction structure determination, TGA and microanalysis. Selected FTIR (KBr, cm−1): 1655, 1578, 1439, 1419, 1383, 1362, 1298, 1254, 1101, 1049, 777, 756, 729, 488; anal. for C36H53Cu2N5O19, calcd: C 43.81%, H 5.41%, N 7.10%; found: C 43.79%, H 5.49%, N 6.91%.
