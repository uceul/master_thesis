
A mixture of BeSO4·4H2O (0.089 g), H3PO4 (0.144 g, 85 wt%), 4,4′-bipyridine (0.078 g), H2O (1.0 mL), and n-butanol (4.0 mL) was sealed in a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave and heated at 180 °C for 7 days. The autoclave was subsequently allowed to cool to room temperature. Colorless crystals were recovered by filtration, washed with distilled water, and finally dried at ambient temperature (57.1% yield based on beryllium). IR (KBr pellets, cm−1): 3090(m), 1620(m), 1490(m), 1120(s), 903(m), 683(m), 492(m).
