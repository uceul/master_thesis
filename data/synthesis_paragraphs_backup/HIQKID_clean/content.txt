U6O4(OH)4(fum)5(form)2(H2O)2·3DMF (2): a mixture of 100 mg (0.26 mmol) of UCl4, 30 mg (0.27 mmol) of fumaric acid, 1.5 mL (39 mmol) of formic acid, 30 μL (1.67 mmol) of water and 4 mL (51 mmol) of N,N-dimethylformamide was placed in a Parr autoclave and then heated at 150 °C for 1 day. The resulting black powder was then filtered off, washed with DMF, and dried at room temperature in air atmosphere. The final product is stable in air for several weeks. 2 was analyzed by scanning electron microscope (Hitachi S-3400N), and it shows a mixture of spherical particles and small crystals with octahedral shape (Figure S2). Yield: 64% (based on uranium). Chemical analysis: C: obs.: 15.05%, calc.: 15.06%; N: obs.: 1.53%, calc.: 1.70%; H: obs.: 1.81%, calc.: 1.46%).
