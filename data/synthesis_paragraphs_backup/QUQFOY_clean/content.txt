A mixture of H6BHB (5.0 mg, 0.009 mmol) and Cd(NO3)2·4H2O (10.3 mg, 0.033 mmol) was dissolved in DMF (2 mL) and EtOH (1 mL) in a screw-capped vial. The vial was capped and placed in an oven at 65 °C for 24 h. The resulting polyhedral prism shaped single crystals were washed with DMF several times to produce MOF-3 (6.2 mg, yield: 57.2%).
