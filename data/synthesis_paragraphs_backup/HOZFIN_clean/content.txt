A solution of LiOH·H2O (20 mg, 0.48 mmol) in 1.0 mL of cellosolve was added to a 1,2,4-benzenetricarboxylic acid (80 mg, 0.38 mmol) dissolved in 1.0 mL of 1,4-dioxane. The resultant solution was sealed in a glass tube and heated at 80 °C during 24 h. Colorless octahedral crystals were filtered off and washed with 0.5 mL of acetone (yield 83.3 mg, 0.040 mmol, 90% based on lithium). Anal. Calcd for C86H101Li11O58 (%): C, 48.29; H, 4.76. Found: C, 48.00; H, 4.51.
