
A mixture of Na2MoO4·2H2O (0.121 g, 0.5 mmol), H3PO4 (0.28 mL, 4 mmol), CoCl2·6H2O (0.119 g, 0.5 mmol), bix (0.119 g, 0.5 mmol), and H2O (6 mL) was stirred for 0.5 h in air. The pH was then adjusted to 4.0 using dilute en solution and 4 M HCl. The mixture was transferred to a Teflon-lined autoclave (23 mL) and kept at 160 °C for 5 d. After the sample had slowly cooled to room temperature, black crystals were filtered off, washed with distilled water and dried in a desiccator at room temperature to give a yield of 47.3% based on Mo. Elemental analyses calcd for C6H30Co3Mo4N6O28P4 (1318.79): C, 5.46; H, 2.29; N, 6.37; Co, 13.41; P, 9.39; Mo, 29.10%. Found: C, 5.37; H, 2.41; N, 6.24; Co, 13.36; P, 9.31; Mo, 29.22%.
