Compound 1 was prepared by the hydrothermal method: a mixture of Na2MoO4·2H2O (1.452 g, 6.00 mmol), ZnSO4·H2O (0.516 g, 2.88 mmol), H3PO4 (2 mL, 30 mmol), and 1,3-bis (4-pyridyl) propane (0.382 g, 2.62 mmol) was dissolved in 36 mL of water. The mixture was stirred for 0.5 h at room temperature and then heated in a 50 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave for 7 days at 165 °C. After the autoclave was cooled to room temperature, the deep red block crystals were isolated. Then the crystals were washed with distilled water, filtered and dried at room temperature (yield 45.3% based on Mo) [9].
