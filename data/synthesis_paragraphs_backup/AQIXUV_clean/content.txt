A solvothermal reaction of H3L (30 mg, 0.05 mmol), bpe (18 mg, 0.1 mmol) and Ni(NO3)2·6H2O (24 mg, 0.1 mmol) in 6 mL DMF/H2O (4:2 vol ratio) was performed in a teflon-lined acid digestion bomb at 80 °C for 72 h, the mixture was then cooled to room temperature naturally. Green strip crystals were collected by filtration with a yield of ca. 48% based on H3L. For 2, no crystals were obtained in the absence of bpe under the same synthetic conditions. Anal. calcd.
