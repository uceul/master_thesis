
The title compound was synthesized from a mixture of NaVO3 (0.58 mmol), Ni(NO3)·6H2O (0.58 mmol), and 4,4′-bipyridyl (0.58 mmol) dissolved in 30 mL of distilled water. The pH of the solution was adjusted to 6.0 using HBO3 1 M solution, and the final mixture was transferred to a 40 mL Teflon-lined autoclave (Parr bomb), sealed and heated at 170 °C for five days. The percentage of the elements was measured by atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS) and C, N, H elemental analysis. [{Ni8(4,4′-Bpy)16}V24O68]·8.5(H2O) Found: Ni 8.64, V 22.51, C 35.40, N 8.22, H 2.30 required: Ni 8.66, V 22.54, C 35.44, N 8.27, H 2.38. The density was measured by the flotation method in a mixture of bromoform/chloroform, being 1.67(2) g cm−3. The IR spectrum shows the bands corresponding to the vibrational modes of the bpy organic molecule and (VO4)3− vanadate anions, which appear in the 1600–990 and 930–530 cm−1, ranges, respectively. The characteristic bands of the bpy molecule δ(ring), δ(CN) and δ(CC) appear at 990, 1530, 1605 cm−1, respectively. The broad band near at 3430 cm−1 confirms the existence of crystallization water molecules into the crystal structure (ESI, Fig. S1). The studied compound was characterized by X-ray powder diffraction data. The patterns were recorded in a BRUKER D8 ADVANCE Vario Diffractometer (Cu Kα = 1.54053 Å), between 5° and 70° in 2θ, counting 5 s per step (0.015°). The Rietveld analysis of the powder patterns indicates the absence of impurities in the different samples (ESI, Fig. S2).
