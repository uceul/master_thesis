
Cu-based materials were prepared by adding 2,5-dihydroxyterephthalic acid (H2dhtp) and trihydrated copper nitrate(II) (0.500 g) over 20 mL of N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF). Once these reagents were dissolved, 1 mL of deionized water and/or 2-propanol were added to form a clear greenish solution of different metal:linker molar ratios (1.6, 2.2 and 2.8 Cu2+:1 H2dhtp). This mixture was heated up to 100 °C for 18 hours to yield reddish needle-shaped crystals. After decanting the mother liquor and washing with DMF, the solid product was immersed in methanol, an exchanging solvent with a low boiling point, for 24 hours, renewing it once by a new fresh solvent during this period of time. Finally, the samples were dried at 70 °C under vacuum (0.2 bar). These materials were denoted as Cux-S, where x is the metal–linker molar ratio and S indicates the co-solvent used: W or P for water and 2-propanol, respectively. Samples were finally activated removing the methanol under vacuum and heating prior to N2 and CO2 adsorption–desorption isotherms.
