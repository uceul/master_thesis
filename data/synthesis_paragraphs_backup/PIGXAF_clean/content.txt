Synthesis of 1: A mixture of CdCO3 (174 mg, 1.0 mmol), H2C2O4 (120 mg, 1.33 mmol), DMF (8 mL), and MeOH (6 mL) was sealed in a 25‐mL teflon‐lined stainless‐steel vessel and heated at 170 °C for 7 days. The mixture was then cooled to room temperature and the colorless cube‐like crystals formed were collected, washed with distilled water and diethyl ether, and dried in air. Yield: 120 mg (42 % based on Cd). C,H,N elemental analysis calcd for C13H24Cd3N2O19: C 18.38, H 2.85, N 3.30; found: C 18.02, H 2.97, N 3.24. IR (KBr): =3150 (m), 1632 (s), 1426 (s), 1310 (m), 1210 (w), 1167 (w), 875 (w), 830 (s), 672 cm−1 (w). The product is air stable and insoluble in water and common organic solvents such as DMF and dimethyl sulfoxide. Based on the results of elemental analysis, IR spectroscopy, and TGA, 1 is best formulated as [(H2NMe2)2Cd3(C2O4)4]⋅MeOH⋅2 H2O. Single‐crystal X‐ray diffraction studies showed that 1 contains 2/3 MeOH and 4/3 H2O guest molecules per formula unit.
