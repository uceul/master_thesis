
A mixture of Cd(OAc)2·2H2O (99 mg), 9-AC (55 mg), H2BDC (42 mg), KOH (7 mg), methanol (1 mL) and DMA (4 mL) were mixed and sealed in a 25 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave and heated at 150 °C for 4 days. The autoclave was subsequently cooled to room temperature. Colourless crystals were recovered by filtration, washed with DMA and ethanol, and finally dried at ambient temperature (30.2% yield based on H2BDC). CHN elemental analysis: anal. for 3: C 41.06 wt%, H 3.15 wt%, and N 2.51 wt%; calc. for 3: C 41.11 wt%, H 3.07 wt%, and N 2.66 wt%. IR (KBr, cm−1): 3420 (m), 1566 (s), 1501 (m), 1483 (m), 1399 (s), 1293 (m), 1127 (w), 1094 (m), 1014 (m), 948 (m), 830 (m), 745 (m), 519 (m).
