Synthesis. Initially, the blue needle crystals of 1 were obtained occasionally as a minor product in an attempt to repeat the synthesis of the known compound [H3NC2H4NH3]0.5CoPO4 using a different cobalt source. A reaction mixture of Co3(PO4)2·xH2O (0.2303 g, 0.5 mmol), ethylenediamine (0.4055 g, 6.74 mmol), H3PO4 (85%, 0.5341 g, 4.67 mmol), and water (7.0 mL) was placed in a 23 mL Teflon cup, sealed in a Parr bomb, heated to 190 °C for 72 h, and followed by quenching to room temperature by taking the bomb out of the furnace. The product was a mixture of blue plate and blue needle crystals. The XRD of the manually separated blue-needle crystals indicated it was a new phase. A single crystal was then selected, and the structure was solved. Subsequently, it was found that a fast cooling rate of the reaction made the blue needle of 1 the dominant product, contaminated by a tiny amount of [H3NC2H4NH3]0.5CoPO4. Typically, the cooling was carried out by taking the bomb out of the furnace and quenching in water. The XRD pattern of the powdered needle sample agreed well with that calculated from single-crystal data.
