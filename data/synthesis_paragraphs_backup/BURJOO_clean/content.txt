
A mixture of H3bidc (0.5 mmol), Co(NO3)2Â·6H2O (0.5 mmol), NaOH (1 mmol), bpt (0.5 mmol), triethylamine (0.1 mL) and H2O (10 mL) was placed in a Teflon-lined autoclave under autogenous pressure at 423 K for 4 d. Then red block-like crystals of 1 were obtained and picked out, washed with distilled water and dried in air. Yield: 35% (based on Co(II)). Elemental analysis for C42H40Co2N14O15 (%), Calcd: C, 45.91; H, 3.67; N, 17.85; found: C, 45.69; H, 3.72; N, 17.48. IR (KBr): 3442s, 1617s, 1574s, 1377s, 1217m, 1000m, 847w, 680s.
