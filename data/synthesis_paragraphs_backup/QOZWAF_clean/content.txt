Preparation of 1: Na9[A‐α‐PW9O34]⋅nH2O (PW9) was prepared by the literature method.17 Ni(CH3COO)2⋅4 H2O (0.300 g, 1.21 mmol) and PW9 (0.400 g, 0.16 mmol) were stirred in distilled water (15 mL, 833 mmol) for 5 min, forming a light yellow‐green solution. enMe (0.20 mL, 2.356 mmol) was added dropwise with continuous stirring. Na2WO4⋅2H2O (0.300 g, 0.91 mmol) was added and the resulting mixture was stirred for 120 min. The resulting solution (pHs=8.1) was sealed in a 35 mL stainless steel reactor with a teflon liner steel autoclave, was heated at 170 °C for 3 days, and then cooled to room temperature. Green prismatic crystals of 1 were obtained (pHe=7.9). Elemental analysis calcd (%) for H144C36N24 O95P2Ni15W21: C 5.98, H 2.00, N 4.65; found: C 6.06, H 2.07, N 4.62.
