Cu(NO3)2·3H2O (0.073 g, 0.3 mmol), H2m-bdc (0.033 g, 0.2 mmol), and Hdmtrz (0.020 g, 0.2 mmol) were added to the mixed solvent of DMF, methanol, and H2O in a volume ratio of 1:1:1 (9 mL). The mixture was stirred at room temperature for 10 min, and then the clear blue solution was introduced into a Teflon-lined stainless steel vessel (15 mL), which was sealed and heated at 60 °C for 3 days. After cooling down to room temperature, blue block crystal solids of MAC-8 were isolated and obtained by filtration. The products were washed with the mixed solution of DMF, methanol, and H2O (in a volume ratio of 1:1:1, 9 mL) for three times. Yields: 45% based on Cu(II). Anal.
