Synthesis of TAF‐1: A solution of the crude 4‐thmpyH3 product (0.092 g, 0.5 mmol) in MeOH (15 mL) was added to a stirring solution of Co(Ac)2⋅4 H2O (0.125 g, 0.5 mmol) in MeOH (2 mL). Then, the resulting solution was heated to 393 K in a Teflon‐lined steel autoclave (20 mL) over 72 h and then cooled to RT over 25 h. The resulting X‐ray‐quality, red quadrate block‐shaped single crystals of TAF‐1 were obtained in about 60 % yield (relative to Co). IR (KBr; see the Supporting Information, Figure S15 for the spectrum): =3374 (m), 2921 (m), 2865 (m), 1565 (s), 1413 (s), 1342 (m), 1234 (w), 1094 cm−1 (s); elemental analysis calcd (%) for Co10C53O36N4H102 (TAF‐1): Co 30.06, C 32.47, H 5.24, N 2.86; found: Co 30.12, C 32.01, H 5.45, N 2.41.
