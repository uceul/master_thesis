A mixture of timpt (16.5 mg, 0.030 mmol) and Ni(ClO4)2 · 6H2O (11.9 mg, 0.032 mmol) in water/ethanol (6:1, v/v, 14 ml) was stirred for ≈15 min at room temperature. Then the mixture was transferred and kept in a Teflon lined autoclave at 160 ° C for three days. After cooling to the room temperature, plate light blue crystals were obtained in ≈47% yield (based on ligand). Anal. Found: C, 58.48; H, 4.24; N, 18.37%. Calcd. for C66H54Cl2N18NiO8: C, 58.42; H, 4.01; N, 18.58%.
