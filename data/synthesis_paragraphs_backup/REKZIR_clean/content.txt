Synthesis of [Cd6(MeCO2)4(bpy)2(H2bna)4]·3.5H2O (2). A mixture of Cd(MeCO2)2·2H2O (0.266 g, 1 mmol), H4bna (0.094 g, 0.25 mmol), bpy (0.040 g, 0.25 mmol), and NaOH (0.020 g, 0.50 mmol) in water−ethanol (1:4) (10 mL) was heated for 3 days at 160 °C in a Parr Teflon-lined stainless steel vessel (23 mL), cooled to 100 °C at a rate of 5 °C h-1, and held for 10 h, followed by further cooling to room temperature. Colorless crystals of 2 were collected, washed with water, and dried in air (yield 60%).
