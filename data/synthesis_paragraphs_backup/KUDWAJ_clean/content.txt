An acetone solution (6 mL) containing Cu(NO3)2·6H2O (0.2 mmol) was layered upon an aqueous solution (4 mL) containing H3tci (0.1 mmol), 4,4′-bipy (0.1 mL) and triethylamine (60 μL) in a test tube; blue block crystals of 1 were collected in two weeks. Thermogravimetric analysis of 1 reveals that all guest water molecules are released at 120 °C, with a mass loss of approximately 12.58% (cal. 13.36%), and no further loss up to 250 °C. Then the framework gradually collapses with increasing temperature (Fig. S11). The powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) pattern of the as-synthesized compound matched the simulated pattern well, indicating that the polycrystalline sample is in the pure phase. In addition, the PXRD patterns of acetone-activated samples and dehydrated samples obtained by heating at 100 °C in vacuo indicate that the framework can maintain good crystallinity (Fig. S8).
