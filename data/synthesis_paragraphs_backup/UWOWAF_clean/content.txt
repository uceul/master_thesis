A mixture of MnCl2·4H2O (0.2 mmol, 0.0396 g), H2btdc (0.2 mmol, 0.0508 g) in N,N′-dimethylformamide (DMF; 7 mL), and anhydrous ethanol (8 mL) was stirred for 10 min in air to form a solution, the solution was placed in a Teflon-lined stainless steel vessel (40 mL), and then the vessel was sealed and heated at 100 °C for 2 days. After the mixture was slowly cooled to room temperature, the yellow crystals of 1 were collected by filtration and washed with DMF (yield: 60% based on Mn). Elem anal. Calcd for C42H40Mn3N4O16S6: C, 41.5; H, 3.29; N, 4.61. Found: C, 40.0; H, 3.04; N, 3.15. FT-IR spectrum (cm−1): 1544(s), 1514(s), 1433(s), 1386(s), 1130(w), 1044(w), 772(m).
