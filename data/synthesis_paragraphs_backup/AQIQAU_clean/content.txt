Synthesis of [Cd(bpydb)(H2bpydb)(H2O)]n (1): A mixture of CdCO3 (0.05 mmol, 0.009 g), H2bpydb (0.05 mmol, 0.020 g) was dissolved in 5 mL distilled water. The resulting solution was stirred for about 60 min at room temperature, sealed in a 20-mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave under autogenous pressure at 180 °C for 4 days to yield 12 mg yellow sheet-shaped crystals. Anal. Calcd (Found) for C96H62Cd2N8O17: C, 63.22 (63.20); H, 3.41 (3.43); N, 6.17 (6.14).
