
A mixture of CdCO3 (0.217 g, 0.75 mmol), H4BTC (0.127 g, 0.5 mmol), Bpy (0.078 g, 0.5 mmol), and H2O (10 mL) was added into a 23 mL Teflon-lined autoclave and stirred for 2 h. The vessel was then sealed and heated at 180 °C for 7 d before cooling to room temperature naturally. Pale yellow prismatic crystals of 1 were obtained by filtering the solution, washed by water for several times and dried in air. The calculated content of water per molecule is ∼3.5%, closing the found weight loss of 3.8% from the TGA (Fig. S5, ESI). Yield: 41% (based on the H4BTC). Anal. calcd (%) for C30H18Cd3N2O18: C, 34.93; H, 1.76; N, 2.72. Found: C, 35.27; H, 1.76; N, 2.71.
