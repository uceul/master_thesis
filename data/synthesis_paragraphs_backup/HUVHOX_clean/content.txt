A mixture of Zn(CH3COO)2·2H2O (0.1235 g, 0.5626 mmol), H6L2 (0.0703 g, 0.163 mmol), and 2-methylpiperazine (0.2242 g, 2.238 mmol) in 6.0 mL of distilled water with the pH value adjusted to around 3.5 was sealed in a Parr Teflon-lined autoclave (23 mL) and heated at 120 °C for 40 h. After the sample had been slowly cooled to room temperature, pure orange crystals were manually separated from a small amount of unknown white powder. The pure orange crystals of 2 were obtained as a homogeneous phase based on powder XRD patterns. Yield: 0.0500 g (43%). Anal. Calcd for C14H29N7O14P2Zn2: C, 23.61; H, 4.10; N, 13.77. Found: C, 23.09; H, 4.20; N, 13.27. IR (KBr pellet): 3512m, 3458s, 3221w, 3140w, 3005w, 2961w, 1657m, 1630m, 1526s, 1387m, 1325w, 1290m, 1165m, 1123s, 976m, 854w, 806m, 729m, 669w, 554m cm–1.
