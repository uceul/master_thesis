
A mixture of Zn(CH3COO)2·2H2O (0.22 g), H3PO3 (0.45 g), 2-methyl-piperazine (0.36 g), methanol (3 mL) and H2O (2 mL) in the molar ratio of 1:5.5:3.5:111:74 was sealed in a Teflon-lined autoclave and heated at 155 °C for 7 days. After cooling to room temperature, the resulting product, containing colorless rod-like crystals of I, was recovered by filtration, washed with distilled water, and dried in air (77.4% yield based on zinc).
