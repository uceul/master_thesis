‡ Synthesis of Cd(II)-MOF (1). A MeOH (3 mL) solution of L (46.4 mg, 0.118 mmol) was added to an aqueous (2 mL) solution of Cd(BF4)2 (80 mg, 0.248 mmol). The resulting slurry was sealed in an autoclave (10 mL) and incubated at 90 °C for 3 days. 1 was obtained as colourless crystals in 63% yield (based on L). IR (KBr pellet cm−1): 3358(w), 1606(s), 1483(m), 1405(w), 1287(w), 1230(w), 1049(vs), 796(s), 690(s), 620(m), 520(w). Elemental analysis (%): calcd for C49H42B2CdF8N12O2: C 52.69, H 3.79, N 15.05; found: C 52.47, H 3.52, N 15.46. Synthesis of Cd(II)-MOGs 2–4. The combination of L and Cd(BF4)2 favours the formation of gel in a wide range of ligand/metal ratios (L/Cd(BF4)2 = 1:0.4 (2), 1:0.8 (3), 1:1.6 (4)) in the MeOH–H2O system. An aqueous solution (2 mL) of Cd(BF4)2 (15 mg, 0.047 mmol for 2; 30 mg, 0.093 mmol for 3; 60 mg, 0.186 mmol for 4) was added to a MeOH solution (3 mL) of L (46.4 mg, 0.118 mmol), and the resulting slurry was sonicated for 5 min or left undisturbed overnight to generate 2–4 as stable gels. Synthesis of CdS@Cd(II)-MOG (5) and CdS@Cd(II)-MOF@TiO2 (7). An aqueous solution (2 mL) of Cd(BF4)2 (60 mg, 0.186 mmol) was added to a MeOH (3 mL) solution of L (46.4 mg, 0.118 mmol) and Na2S (5 mg, 0.064 mmol) with a molar ratio of Na2S/L/Cd(BF4)2 = 0.5:1:1.6. The resulting slurry was sonicated to a stable gel phase (5), then TiO2 (25 mg) powder was added and stirred homogeneously. The new TiO2 containing gel was incubated at 90 °C for 20 h and yellow precipitates formed at the bottom of the solution. The obtained yellow crystalline solids were successively washed with MeOH and ether, and then dried in air to generate 7.

Synthesis of CdS@Cd(II)-MOG (6) and CdS@Cd(II)-MOF@TiO2 (8). An aqueous solution (2 mL) of Cd(BF4)2 (60 mg, 0.186 mmol) was added to a MeOH (3 mL) solution of L (46.4 mg, 0.118 mmol) and Na2S (10 mg, 0.128 mmol) with a molar ratio of Na2S/L/Cd(BF4)2 = 1:1:1.6. The resulting slurry was sonicated to a stable gel phase (6), then TiO2 (25 mg) powder was added and stirred homogeneously. The new TiO2 containing gel was incubated at 90 °C for 20 h and yellow precipitates formed at the bottom of the solution. The obtained yellow crystalline solids were successively washed with MeOH and ether, and then dried in air to generate 8. IR (KBr pellet cm−1): 3351(w), 1606(s), 1477(m), 1403(w), 1061(vs), 793(m).
