A solid mixture of H3BBC (30.4 mg, 0.046 mmol), and Cu(NO3)2·2.5H2O (33.3 mg, 0.143 mmol) was dissolved in a mixture of DMF/NMP (5.0/5.0 mL) in a 20 mL vial was heated in an isothermal oven at 85 °C for 48 h to give green octahedral crystals. The reaction mixture was allowed to cool naturally to room temperature, and the crystals were washed with DMF and dried in air. Yield: 18.6 mg, 26% based on H3BBC.
