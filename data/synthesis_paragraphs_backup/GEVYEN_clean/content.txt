
A mixture of 3-(2',5'-dicarboxylphenyl)pyridine (0.025 g, 0.1 mmol), Zn(NO3)2·6H2O (0.059 g, 0.2 mmol) and 1,2-di(4-pyridyl) ethylene (0.018 g, 0.1 mmol) in water (10 mL) was placed in a Teflon-lined stainless steel vessel (25 mL) and heated at 120 °C for 72 h, and then cooled to room temperature at a rate of 5 °C min−1. The resulting colorless block crystals of 1 were isolated by washing with H2O, and dried in air. The yield was 87% (based on H2dcpy). Elemental analysis (%): Calcd for C19H18N2ZnO7: C, 50.52; H, 4.02; N, 6.20. Found: C, 50.56; H, 4.26; N, 6.42. IR (KBr, cm−1): 3542 s, 3059 w, 1614 s, 1580 s, 1562 s, 1497 m, 1406 s, 1363 s, 1280 m, 1228 m, 1226 m, 1154 m, 1032 m, 1041 m, 916 m, 841 m, 731 w, 634 w, 555 m.
