Synthesis of 1. The mixture of L ligand (0.0213 g, 0.1 mmol) and CdCl2·2.5H2O (0.0228 g, 0.1 mmol), in the H2O (10 mL) solution were stirred for 30 min, and then transferred to a 23 mL Teflon container and sealed in an autoclave. The autoclave was heated to 180 ºC in a programmable oven, and this temperature was maintained for 3 days before it was cooled to room temperature (cooling rate 5 °C per min). The colorless crystals are obtained in the yield of 79%, based on Cd. Element Anal. Calc. for 1(%): C, 30.06; H, 2.52; N, 27.26. Found: C 29.89, H 2.79, N 27.17%. IR data (KBr pellet, cm− 1): 3087 (w), 1603 (m), 1555 (m), 1458 (m), 1432 (m), 1303 (s), 1279 (w), 1115 (s), 1081 (s), 998 (m), 798 (w), 722 (s), 654 (m).
