The title compound was synthesized hydrothermally from a starting mixture of MnCl2, H2O2, H2C2O4, H3PO4, H2N(CH2)2NH(CH2)2NH2 and H2O in a molar ratio of 1.0:3.0–9.0:1.0:10:1.0:400. In a typical synthesis procedure, 0.792 g of MnCl2⋅4H2O was dissolved in 30 ml of deionized water, to which 1 ml of H2O2 (40% aq.) was added under vigorous stirring. After 30 min of stirring, H3PO4 (85% aq.) and H2C2O4⋅2H2O were added to the solution successively, and then diethylenetriamine was added under continuous stirring. The reaction mixture was then sealed in a PTFE-lined stainless steel autoclave and heated at 130 °C for 48 h under autogenous pressure. By filtering the product and washing with distilled water and alcohol, we obtained a large quantity of light pink crystals with a very small amount of white powder mixed.
