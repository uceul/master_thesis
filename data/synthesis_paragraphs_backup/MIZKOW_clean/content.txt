Synthesis of 1,2: A mixture of La2(C2O4)3·9 H2O (0.298 g), CuCl2·2 H2O (0.034 g), H2pdc (0.167 g), H2O (10 ml), and CH3COOH (0.5 mmol) was sealed in a 30 ml Teflon-lined bomb at 170 °C for 7 d, then cooled to room temperature. Light prismatic crystals of 1 were obtained (yield: 39% based on CuCl2·2 H2O). Elemental analysis (%) calcd (found) for 1: C, 29.94 (29.64); H, 1.98 (2.36); N, 4.99 (4.75). Compound Ce analogue 2 was also prepared following the preceding procedure, the same PXRD and IR spectra prove that this compound is analogous to compound 1 (Fig. 7, S4). IR spectrum (KBr pellet, ν/cm−1) for 1: 3450(vs), 1611(s), 1568(w), 1402(m), 1316(m), 794(w), 758(w); for 2: 3451(vs), 1612(s), 1567(w), 1401(m), 1317(m), 794(w), 758(w).
