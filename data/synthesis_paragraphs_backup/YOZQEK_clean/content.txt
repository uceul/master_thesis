Synthesis of UoC‐2: In a 20 mL vial, Zn(NO3)2⋅6 H2O (0.147 g, 0.49 mmol) and H2L2 (0.05 g, 0.16 mmol) were dissolved in DMF (10 mL) at room temperature. The vial was placed in a temperature controlled oven at 95 °C. Transparent, rod‐like crystals were formed within 24 h. Yield; 0.145 g, based on Zn(NO3)2⋅6 H2O.
