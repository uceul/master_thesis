A mixture of Zn(CH3COO)2·2H2O (0.150 g, 0.7 mmol), NH4VO3 (0.047 g, 0.4 mmol), bpp (0.03 g, 0.15 mmol) and H2O (8 mL) was stirred for 30 min at room temperature. Then the mixture was sealed in a 15 mL Teflon reactor at 100 °C for 3 days. After slowly cooling to room temperature, yellow block crystals of 4 were filtered and washed with deionized water. Yield: 55% (based on Zn). Anal. calcd for C52H56N8Zn3O24V6 (1678.80): C 37.20, H 3.36, N 6.67, Zn 11.68, V 18.20; found C 37.35, H 3.12, N 6.81, Zn 11.32, V 18.47. IR (KBr pellet, cm−1): 3445 (s), 2931 (s), 1613 (w), 1504 (m), 1424 (m), 936 (s), 897 (m), 727 (w), 631 (m).
