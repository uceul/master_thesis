A mixture of H4X (0.05 mmol, 30.8 mg) and Cd(NO3)2·6H2O (0.11 mmol, 28.2 mg) was dissolved in 5 mL of DMA in a 20 mL vial. The reaction vial was capped tightly and heated at 110 °C for 72 h. The mixture was then gradually cooled to room temperature at a rate of 10 °C/h, and colorless rectangular crystals of 3 were obtained with 82% yield.
