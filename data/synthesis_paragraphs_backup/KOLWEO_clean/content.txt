
A mixture of H3BTB (30 mg, 0.68 mmol), Ni(NO3)2·6H2O (30 mg, 1.02 mmol) and 4,4′-bipyridine (32 mg, 2.05 mmol) in 2 ml of a DEF/EG/Toluene (molar ratio 1.3:1.7:1.0) solvent mixture was placed in a 23 ml Teflon-lined autoclave and stirred for 2 minutes to homogenise the mixture. The autoclave was sealed and heated at 120 °C for 48 h. The green block crystals were recovered by filtration and washed successively with DEF, EtOH and water followed by air-drying. Yield = 63 mg (71%) Elemental analysis found (%) for bulk as-synthesised 2: C 65.72, H 4.94, N 4.92. Calculated for [Ni3(C27H15O6)2(C10H8N2)3(C2H6O2)3]·1.5(Toluene) (%): C 65.61, H 4.60, N 4.57.
