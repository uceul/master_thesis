The synthesis of complex [Co3(bpp)2(D-Hcam)2(fipbb)2(H2O)2]·2H2O (1):A mixture of Co(NO3)2·6H2O (0.5 mmol, 0.146 g), H2hfipbb (0.1 mmol, 0.039 g), D-(+)-H2cam (0.25 mmol, 0.05 g), bpp (0.25 mmol, 0.0495 g), H2O (3 ml), EtOH (3 ml) and DMF (1 ml) was mixed in a 13 ml Teflon reactor and then stirred at room temperature until it became homogeneous, which was heated at 383 K for four days and then cooled to room temperature at a rate of 10 K h-1. Pink crystals were washed and dried in air (yield 47%, based on Co(NO3)2·6H2O). Elemental analysis (%) calcd. for 1 (C80H71F12N4O18Co3): C, 53.94%; H, 4.02%; N, 3.15%. Found: C, 53.92%; H, 4.06%; N, 3.17%.
