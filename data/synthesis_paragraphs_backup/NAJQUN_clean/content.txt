A mixture of Mn(OAc)2∙4H2O (0.1 mmol, 0.025 g), H4ttac (0.05 mmol, 0.020 g), DMF (2 mL) and H2O (6 mL) was sealed in a 25-mL Teflon-lined reactor. The reactor was heated at 85 °C for 72 h, and then cooled to room temperature at a rate of 5 °C h−1. Colorless block crystals of 2 were obtained in 40% yield based on H4ttac, washed with water, and air-dried. Anal. Calcd for C53H53Mn4N3O25: C, 47.09; H, 3.95; N, 3,11. Found: C, 46.91; H, 3.59; N, 2.87. IR (KBr pellet, cm−1): 3315w, 2935w, 1665s, 1646w, 1587m, 1538m, 1400s, 1182s, 1108s, 1014 m, 923 m, 858m, 789s, 731 m, 671 m.
