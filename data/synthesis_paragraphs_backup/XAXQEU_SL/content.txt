A mixture of trans-1,4-H2chdc (0.06 g, 0.35 mmol) and InCl3·4H2O (0.05 g, 0.17 mmol) was added to 4 ml of H2O and 2 ml CH3CN in a 23 ml Teflon-lined stainless steel vessel autoclave. The mixture was sealed and heated at 160 oC for three days. The colorless needle crystals were obtained by filtration and washed with H2O and CH3CN for several times. The yield of product was 60% in weight based on indium. The elemental analysis results are listed as follows: anal. Calc. for C8H11InO5 (%): C, 31.79; H, 3.64. Found: C, 31.65; H, 3.76. IR (KBr pellet, cm−1): 3423 (br, s), 2961 (w), 2855 (w), 1563 (s), 1426 (s), 1308 (w), 1116 (s), 871(w), 777 (w), 541 (m).
