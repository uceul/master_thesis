A mixture of Co(NO3)2·6H2O (29.1 mg, 0.1 mmol), TPPA (47.6 mg, 0.1 mmol), and benzene-p-dicarboxylic acid (33.2 mg, 0.2 mmol) was dissolved in 15 mL of DMF/MeCN/H2O (1:2:3). The final mixture was placed in a Parr Teflon-lined stainless steel vessel (25 mL) under autogenous pressure and heated at 85 °C for 3 days. Orange crystals of 5 were collected in 56% yield (based on TPPA ligand). Calcd for CoC41H38N4O9: C, 62.36%; H, 4.85%; N, 7.09%. Found: C, 62.40%; H, 4.86%; N, 7.11%.
