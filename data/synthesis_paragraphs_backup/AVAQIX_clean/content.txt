Synthesis 1: Cd(NO3)2·4H2O (0.25 mmol) and isonicotinic acid (1.25 mmol) were dissolved in 5 mL N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF), respectively. The two solutions were mixed and kept at 80 °C for 3 weeks. 0.049 g (43% yield based on Cd) colorless rectangular crystals were collected after filtration. It was found that the crystals gradually lost crystallinity upon exposure to the atmosphere, due to the escape of crystallization DMF. They were stored in the filtrate for further characterization.
