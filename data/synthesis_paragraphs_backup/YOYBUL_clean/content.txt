A mixture of Zn(NO3)2·6H2O (0.045 g, 0.15 mmol), bpydbH2 (0.032 g, 0.075 mmol), bpy (0.015 g, 0.1 mmol), DMA (2 mL), H2O (0.5 mL), and EtOH (0.5 mL) was mixed in a 5 mL glass bottle and then heated to 120 °C for 3 days under autogenous pressure. After the mixture was cooled to room temperature, yellow block crystals suitable for X-ray diffraction analysis were obtained. The yield was 53% for 3 (based on bpydbH2). IR (KBr, cm–1): 3422 (br), 3018 (br), 1594 (s), 1384(s), 1107 (s), 1016 (s), 867 (m), 815 (s), 790 (m), 747 (m), 707 (m), 620 (m). Elemental analysis calcd (%) for 3 (C50H67N5O11Zn): C, 61.19; H, 7.09; N, 7.14; found: C 61.05, H 7.12, N 7.06.
