A mixture containing Cd(NO3)2·4H2O (0.0308 g, 0.1 mmol), 4-Hpzpt (0.0448 g, 0.2 mmol), H2nbc (0.0216 g, 0.1 mmol), NaOH(0.004 g, 0.1 mol), deionized water (4 mL) and CH3OH (4 mL) was sealed in a 25 mL Teflon-lined reactor, which was heated at 160 °C for 3 days and then cooled to room temperature at a rate of 2 °C/h. Yellowish crystals were isolated in 63% yield. Anal. Calcd for C35H22N6O9Cd2 (%): C, 46.95; H, 2.48; N, 9.39. Found (%): C, 46.91; H, 2.50; N, 9.41.
