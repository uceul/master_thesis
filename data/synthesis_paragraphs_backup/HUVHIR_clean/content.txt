A mixture of Zn(CH3COO)2·2H2O (0.1021 g, 0.4651 mmol), H9L1 (0.0591 g, 0.102 mmol), and 2-methylpiperazine (1.00 g, 9.98 mmol) in 8.0 mL of distilled water with the pH value adjusted to around 3.9 was sealed in a Parr Teflon-lined autoclave (23 mL) and heated at 110 °C for 120 h. After the sample had been slowly cooled to room temperature, colorless crystals were obtained as a homogeneous phase based on powder XRD patterns. Yield: 0.0254 g (26%). Anal.
