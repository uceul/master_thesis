A mixture of Co(CH3COO)2·4H2O (0.196 g, 0.787 mmol), H3btc (0.188 g, 0.895 mmol), NaOH (0.100 g, 2.50 mmol) and H2O (21 ml) was stirred for 1 h at room temperature, then the reaction mixture was adjusted to pH 7.0 with the solution of NaOH, and sealed in a 30 ml stainless-steel reactor with Teflon inner, and heated at 160 °C for 72 h under autogenous pressure. After cooling to ambient temperature, the purple tetragonal prismatic crystals were collected by filtration and characterized by crystallographic analysis. Yield: 46% (based on Co). Anal. calcd. For C18H26Co3O22: Co, 22.99; C, 28.12; H, 3.12%. Found: Co, 23.01; C, 28.26; H, 3.09%.
