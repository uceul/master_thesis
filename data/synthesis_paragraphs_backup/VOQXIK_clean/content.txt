A solution of LiOH·H2O (10 mg, 0.24 mmol) in 1.0 mL of C2H5OH was added to a 1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylic acid (80 mg, 0.38 mmol) dissolved in 3.0 mL of NMP by sonication within 30 min. The resultant solution was sealed in a glass tube and heated at 80 °C during 3 days. Colorless octahedral crystals were filtered and washed with 0.5 mL of acetone (yield 8.0 mg, 0.0056 mmol, 12% based on lithium). Anal. Calcd for C64H84Li5N7O18 (%): C, 60.33; H, 6.64; N, 7.69.
