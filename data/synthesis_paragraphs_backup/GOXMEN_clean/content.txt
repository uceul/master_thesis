A mixture of Co(NO3)2·6H2O (0.082 g, 0.28 mmol), BIIBN (0.04 g, 0.14 mmol), and dilute sodium hydroxide (0.1 mL) in H2O (6 mL) was placed in a Teflon lined stainless steel autoclave and heated at 180 °C for 1 day under autogenous pressure. Then it was allowed to cool to room temperature at the rate of 1 °C/min to afford pink colored needle-shaped crystals. Yield: ∼40%. Anal. Calc. for C51H43N13O14Co2: C, 51.92; H, 3.67; N, 15.43. Found: C, 54.8; H, 3.88; N, 15.14%. IR (cm−1, KBr pellet): 3399(s), 3108(s), 1562(s), 1503(s), 1422(s), 1384(s), 1313(s), 1239(s), 1068(s), 743(s) (Fig. S5).
