Synthesis of [Ni3(μ3‐OH)2(TBAPy)(H2O)4]·guests (1): A mixture of Ni(NO3)2·9H2O (13 mg, 0.045mmol) and H4TBAPy (10 mg 0.015 mmol) was dissolved in DMF, dioxane, and H2O (5 mL) in a ratio of 2:1:1 and concentrated HCl (10 μL) was sealed in scintillation vials. The mixture was sonicated for 30 min and the green‐yellow slurry was heated at 120 °C for 72 h. The reaction was cooled to 40 °C at a rate of 12 °C·h–1. Green needle‐shape crystals suitable for singe crystal X‐ray diffraction were isolated with a yield of 47 % based on Ni. The crystals were washed with DMF and dried in the atmosphere overnight. The formula of 1 was determined by elemental analysis as [Ni3(μ3‐OH)2(H2O)4(TBAPy)]·(DMF)2.2(dioxane)1.2: calcd. C 54.30, H 4.65, N 2.51 %; found C 54.44, H 4.42, N 2.43 %.
