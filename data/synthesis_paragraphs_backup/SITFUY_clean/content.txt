‡ Preparation of JLU-Liu2: A mixture of H2TBA (0.0076 g, 0.04 mmol) and CuCl2·2H2O (0.0136 g, 0.08 mmol) in 1.0 ml N,N′-dimethylformamide (DMF) and 1.0 ml EtOH was sealed in a 20 mL vial, then heated at 65 °C for 3 d to give green truncated octahedron-shaped crystals (73% yield based on CuCl2·2H2O). Elemental analysis (wt%): Calcd for C38H47ClCu4N18O18: C 34.2, H 3.50, N 18.9. Found: C 33.7, H 3.42, N 18.1.
