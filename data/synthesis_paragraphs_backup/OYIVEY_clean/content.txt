A 2.0 mL portion of 4-TBA solution (0.20 M) in 1:1 solution of N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) and ethanol (EtOH) was taken in a 5 mL vial. A 0.5 mL portion of Cu(NO3)2·3H2O solution (0.20 M) in DMF was added to this solution. The vial was capped and heated to 85 °C for 96 h. The mother liquor was decanted, and the octahedral blue crystals were filtered off and washed with EtOH. The unreacted ligand can be removed by washing in DMF (3 mL, 4 times) as 4-TBA is highly soluble in DMF, and afterward the resulting MOF was dried in air (10 min). [Yield: 54%, 0.0130 g depending on Cu(NO3)2·3H2O]. FT-IR: (KBr 4000–600 cm–1): 3039(m, br), 2795(w, br), 2356(m), 1660(s), 1611(s), 1393(s), 1246(m), 1091(s), 868(m), 742(m) cm–1. Element analysis: Found (%) C = 39.20, H = 1.99, N = 22.24; Calc. (%) C = 40.24, H = 1.96, N = 21.82.
