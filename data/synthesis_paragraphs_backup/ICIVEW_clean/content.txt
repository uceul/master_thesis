Synthesis and characterization: Typically, Zn(OAc)2⋅2 H2O (0.25 g) was first dissolved in H2O (10 mL), and then n‐butylamine (0.51 mL) was added while stirring. Finally, H3PO3 (0.280 g) was added to the above reaction mixture. A homogeneous reaction gel (pH≈6) was formed after stirring for 1 h, and this gel was sealed in a 15‐mL Teflon‐lined stainless‐steel autoclave and heated at 180 °C for three days under static conditions. The colorless, rod‐shaped single crystals obtained were separated by sonication, washed with distilled water, and then dried in the air.
