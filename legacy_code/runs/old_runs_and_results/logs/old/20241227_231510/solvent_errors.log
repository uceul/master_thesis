Original text: The reaction of 4,4′-bipyridine with CdSO4·8/3H2O in water in 1:1 mole ratio in a sealed tube at 120°C gave 1 as pure crystalline product in 57% yield. A sample of 256 mg (1.0 mmol) CdSO4·8/3H2O and 156 mg (1.0 mmol) 4,4′-bipyridine was mixed thoroughly and loaded into a thick-walled Pyrex tube. After ∼1.0 ml H2O was added, the tube was frozen with liquid N2, evacuated under vacuum and sealed with a flame. The reaction was carried out at 120°C for 24 h to afford colorless single crystals of 1. The product was isolated by acetone washing in 57% yield. The compound is insoluble in common organic solvents such as THF, acetone, CH2Cl2, and CH3CN or water. The single crystal X-ray structure analysis showed that 1 crystallizes in the C-centered, noncentrosymmetric space group C2 (No. 5). Crystallographic data for 1, C20H28Cd2N4O14S2, monoclinic C2 (No. 5), a=24.624(1), b=9.7554(5), c=13.5956(7) Å, β=120.663(1)°, V=2809.2(2) Å3, Z=4, ρcalc=1.980 g cm−3, μ=1.740 mm−1, T=295 K, structure solution and refinement based on 5239 reflections including Friedel mates (3254 unique) with Io≥3.0σ(Io) converged at R=0.0342, Rw=0.0481 and goodness-of-fit=1.85. Data were collected on a Siemens SMART diffractometer using Mo Kα radiation (λ=0.71073 Å). An empirical absorption correction based on redundant reflections was applied to the data set. The absolute configuration was unambiguously assigned based on the analysis of the Bijovot pairs and the refinement of the Flack parameter. The absence of inversion center in the structure was also confirmed by MISYM. The refinement of Flack parameter for the chosen configuration gave 0.00020(9) with 5239 reflections where Fc(H) and Fc(–H) differ by more than 0.0001. The asymmetric unit contains two Cd2+ ions, two 4,4′-bipy ligands, two SO4 2− anions, and three coordinate and three crystallization water molecules. The metal centers are first linked by the SO4 2− anions to form the one-dimensional arrays of fused 12-membered rings containing three cadmium, three sulfur and six oxygen atoms (see Fig. 1). The arrays are drawn together by hydrogen bonding between the coordinate water molecules and the SO4 2− anions from the adjacent net. The two SO4 2− anions are split into μ2- and μ3-bridging ligands. Thus, Cd(1) is coordinated by a μ2-SO4 2−, a μ3-SO4 2− and two cis-H2O molecules while the Cd(2) is linked by a μ2-SO4 2−, two different μ3-SO4 2− anions and a water. The 4,4′-bipy ligands act as ‘posts’ that connect the cadmium centers to form the one-dimensional [Cd2(4,4′-bipy)2(H2O)3]n 4+ chains. The coordination of both Cd atoms can best be described as slightly distorted octahedral with four O atoms situated in the square plane and two N atoms occupying the axial positions. Fig. 2 depicts the coordination environments of the two Cd atoms. Rather than being parallel, these chains run across each other from two different directions. Thus, the compound forms three-dimensional interwoven networks as shown in Fig. 3. The most common coordination modes of the SO4 2− ion are monodentate, bidentate and μ2-bridging, while μ3-bridging is much less frequent [11]. The combination of both μ2- and μ3-bridging in the same structure is hitherto unreported. The fact that 1 crystallizes in a noncentrosymmetric space group can perhaps be attributed to this unusual combination of the two different bridging modes for the SO4 2− anion. We have noticed that the use of simple, weaker coordinating anions such as NO3 − and ClO4 − results in centrosymmetric more often than noncentrosymmetric crystal packing....

The reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature to homogeneity and then placed in a Teflon-lined stainless vessel (40 mL) and heated to 180 °C (1) for 3 days under autogenous pressure and afterwards cooled to room temperature. The resulting product contains large single crystals and microcrystalline powder, which were separated by ultrasound, filtered off individually, washed thoroughly with distilled water, and finally air-dried at room temperature.

Commercially available meso-tetra(4-carboxyphenyl)porphyrin-Fe(III) chloride (FeTCP-Cl, 53 mg, 0.06 mmol) was added to give a dark-purple suspension. The mixture was placed in a 120 °C oven for 48 h. The reaction vial was removed from the oven and allowed to cool to room temperature. The supernatant was gently decanted, and then fresh N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF, 20 mL) was added to the vial and shaken. The suspension was transferred to a 50 mL centrifuge vial. The dark (orange under microscope) crystals were isolated by centrifugation, washed five times with fresh DMF (45 mL through repeated centrifugation), and then soaked in fresh DMF (45 mL) for 12 h at 50 °C to wash any unreacted species from the resulting MOF crystals. Then, the dark crystals were isolated by centrifugation, resuspended in acetone (45 mL), and washed five times with fresh acetone (45 mL). Finally, the crystals were soaked in acetone (45 mL) for 12 h for a final rinse. The solid was activated at room temperature under vacuum followed by 120 °C under vacuum for 12 h to yield needlelike crystals with hexagonal faces of Hf-2 (55 mg, 49% yield)....

Original text: A mixture of Zn(OAc)2·2H2O (0.052 g, 0.24 mmol) and [Cu(HIm)4](NO3)2 (0.092 g, 0.20 mmol) was dissolved using a solvent mixture of DMF/water/MeOH (2/1/1, v/v). The pH of the solution mixture was adjusted to ca. 5.4 by addition of acetic acid. The solution mixture was then introduced to a borosilicate glass tube. The tube was flash frozen at 77 K using a liquid N2 bath, evacuated for 15 min to remove oxygen, and then flame-sealed to maintain a oxygen-free environment inside the tube during the reaction process. After the sealed reaction tube was heated at 85 °C for 4 d, truncated colorless crystals were obtained. The crystals were subsequently collected and washed with DMF, water, and MeOH (3 × 2 mL, each) before SXRD analysis. For the activation procedure, as-synthesized ZIF-202 was washed five times with DMF per day (5 mL each), exchanged nine times with anhydrous MeOH (5 mL each) over the course of 3 d, and then activated at 80 °C under reduced pressure (1 mTorr) for 24 h.

Original text: 1 is constructed from 1,2,4,5-tetrakis(3-carboxyphenyl)-benzene (m-H4TCPB) (Scheme 1), which can be straightforwardly synthesized by the coupling and hydrolysis reaction, from its precursor. A mixture of Cu(NO3)2·3H2O (0.02 g) and m-H4TCPB (0.01 g) was dissolved in N, N′-diethylformamide (DEF, 1.5 mL), water (0.4 mL), and con. HCl (8 μL). The final mixture was placed in a 20 mL glass vial, which was sealed and heated at 75 °C for 24 h, and then cooled to room temperature. Rhombus-shaped turquoise crystals of 1 were collected in 42% yield (based on ligand m-H4TCPB). Anal. calcd for C49H55O13N3Cu2: C, 57.64; H, 5.43; and N, 4.12. Found: C, 57.70; H, 5.46; and N, 4.17. IR/cm− 1: 2972 (m), 1615 (m), 1538 (s), 1395 (s), 1371 (s), 820(m), 767 (s), and 710(s). It was formulated on the bases of single-crystal X-ray structure determination, elemental analysis, and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). A single-crystal X-ray crystallographic study revealed that 1 crystallizes in the monoclinic system and C2/c space group [18]. As quite frequently observed in MOFs, the framework contains paddle-wheel binuclear {Cu2(COO)4} secondary building units (Fig. 1a), which are bridged by organic m-TCPB ligands to form a two-dimensional (2D) hexagonal grid {Cu2(m-TCPB)2} (Fig. 1b). The adjacent 2D hexagonal grid is packed in parallel, leading to the final porous-containing three-dimensional (3D) frameworks with the cavities of 8.5 × 12.6 Å2 (Fig. 1d). The structure of 1 is non-interpenetrated and the topology (Fig. S2) can be best described as a simple 4, 4 connected net (Fig. 1c, d), which exhibits the same topology as well-established MOFs, such as: MOF-2 Zn(BDC)-(DMF), Cu(BDC-OH), Zn2(TBAPy), and UTSA-72 [19], [20], [21], [22]. The fifth coordination sites of paddle–wheel Cu2(COO)4 units were occupied by water molecules, which will be critical for the gas-absorption selectivity. Upon water molecules removal, the open sites will be exposed for other applications. The solvent accessible volume after the removal of the uncoordinated solvents is 59.6% calculated with PLATON [23]....
