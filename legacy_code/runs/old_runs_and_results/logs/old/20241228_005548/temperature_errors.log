Original text:   An aqueous solution (1 mL) of H3tci (0.02 mmol) was slowly added dropwise into a methanol solution (5 mL) of Cu(NO3)2·3H2O (0.02 mmol), and then mixed with 0.03 mol L−1methanol solution of CH3ONa (0.05 mL) to give a clear green solution. About three weeks later, good-quality green crystals were obtained from the resultant solution at room temperature. Yield: 24% (based on Cu). Anal.

Original text: [Zn4O(bpz)2(abdc)]⋅guest (1⋅g, MAF‐X11). A mixture of H2abdc (0.068 g, 0.375 mmol), H2bpz (0.143 g, 0.75 mmol), Zn(NO3)2⋅6 H2O (0.446 g, 1.5 mmol), N,N‐dimethylformamide (30 mL), and EtOH (20 mL) was placed in a Teflon‐lined stainless steel vessel (100 mL) and heated at 120 °C for 72 h, and then it was cooled to room temperature at a rate of 0.1 °C min−1. The resulting pale‐yellow block polycrystals (Figure S5) of 1⋅g were isolated by decanting and treated with ethanol and dried under vacuum (yield 203 mg, 45 %). Single crystals for X‐ray single‐crystal diffraction were prepared by heating a solution of H2abdc (0.009 g, 0.025 mmol), H2bpz (0.010 g, 0.05 mmol), and Zn(NO3)2⋅6 H2O (0.030 g, 0.10 mmol) in a mixed solvent of N,N‐dimethylformamide and EtOH (v/v=2/1, 3 mL) in a sealed glass tube (1.0 cm o.d.×10 cm length) at 130 °C for 72 h, and then the mixture was cooled to room temperature at a rate of 0.1 °C min−1 to give pale‐yellow block single crystals (25 mg, yield 84 %).
