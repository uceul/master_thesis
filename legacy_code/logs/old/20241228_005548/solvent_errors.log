Original text: The reaction of 4,4′-bipyridine with CdSO4·8/3H2O in water in 1:1 mole ratio in a sealed tube at 120°C gave 1 as pure crystalline product in 57% yield. A sample of 256 mg (1.0 mmol) CdSO4·8/3H2O and 156 mg (1.0 mmol) 4,4′-bipyridine was mixed thoroughly and loaded into a thick-walled Pyrex tube. After ∼1.0 ml H2O was added, the tube was frozen with liquid N2, evacuated under vacuum and sealed with a flame. The reaction was carried out at 120°C for 24 h to afford colorless single crystals of 1. The product was isolated by acetone washing in 57% yield. The compound is insoluble in common organic solvents such as THF, acetone, CH2Cl2, and CH3CN or water. The single crystal X-ray structure analysis showed that 1 crystallizes in the C-centered, noncentrosymmetric space group C2 (No. 5). Crystallographic data for 1, C20H28Cd2N4O14S2, monoclinic C2 (No. 5), a=24.624(1), b=9.7554(5), c=13.5956(7) Å, β=120.663(1)°, V=2809.2(2) Å3, Z=4, ρcalc=1.980 g cm−3, μ=1.740 mm−1, T=295 K, structure solution and refinement based on 5239 reflections including Friedel mates (3254 unique) with Io≥3.0σ(Io) converged at R=0.0342, Rw=0.0481 and goodness-of-fit=1.85. Data were collected on a Siemens SMART diffractometer using Mo Kα radiation (λ=0.71073 Å). An empirical absorption correction based on redundant reflections was applied to the data set. The absolute configuration was unambiguously assigned based on the analysis of the Bijovot pairs and the refinement of the Flack parameter. The absence of inversion center in the structure was also confirmed by MISYM. The refinement of Flack parameter for the chosen configuration gave 0.00020(9) with 5239 reflections where Fc(H) and Fc(–H) differ by more than 0.0001. The asymmetric unit contains two Cd2+ ions, two 4,4′-bipy ligands, two SO4 2− anions, and three coordinate and three crystallization water molecules. The metal centers are first linked by the SO4 2− anions to form the one-dimensional arrays of fused 12-membered rings containing three cadmium, three sulfur and six oxygen atoms (see Fig. 1). The arrays are drawn together by hydrogen bonding between the coordinate water molecules and the SO4 2− anions from the adjacent net. The two SO4 2− anions are split into μ2- and μ3-bridging ligands. Thus, Cd(1) is coordinated by a μ2-SO4 2−, a μ3-SO4 2− and two cis-H2O molecules while the Cd(2) is linked by a μ2-SO4 2−, two different μ3-SO4 2− anions and a water. The 4,4′-bipy ligands act as ‘posts’ that connect the cadmium centers to form the one-dimensional [Cd2(4,4′-bipy)2(H2O)3]n 4+ chains. The coordination of both Cd atoms can best be described as slightly distorted octahedral with four O atoms situated in the square plane and two N atoms occupying the axial positions. Fig. 2 depicts the coordination environments of the two Cd atoms. Rather than being parallel, these chains run across each other from two different directions. Thus, the compound forms three-dimensional interwoven networks as shown in Fig. 3. The most common coordination modes of the SO4 2− ion are monodentate, bidentate and μ2-bridging, while μ3-bridging is much less frequent [11]. The combination of both μ2- and μ3-bridging in the same structure is hitherto unreported. The fact that 1 crystallizes in a noncentrosymmetric space group can perhaps be attributed to this unusual combination of the two different bridging modes for the SO4 2− anion. We have noticed that the use of simple, weaker coordinating anions such as NO3 − and ClO4 − results in centrosymmetric more often than noncentrosymmetric crystal packing....
