In a typical synthesis, 0.099 g of iron oxalate was dissolved in 2 ml of water followed by the addition of 0.3826 g of As2O5 under continuous stirring. Finally 0.0478 g of piperazine was added and the mixture was homogenized for 30 min at room temperature.

The initial pH of the mixture was about 2.0 and after the reaction the pH did not show any appreciable variation. The resulting product, a mixture of powder and pale greenish single crystals, was filtered under vacuum and dried at ambient temperature. The single crystals were separated easily from the mixture physically under a polarizing microscope. The same reaction mixture at 125 \u00b0C for 96 h yielded a single phasic pale greenish powder, which was identified as the title compound by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), by comparison with the simulated XRD pattern from single crystal data. This sample was used for all other characterizations such as thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and magnetic measurements.

In a typical synthesis, 0.099 g of iron oxalate was dissolved in 2 ml of water followed by the addition of 0.3826 g of As2O5 under continuous stirring. Finally 0.0478 g of piperazine was added and the mixture was homogenized for 30 min at room temperature. The final mixture with the composition, Fe(C2O4).2H2O:3As2O5:C4N2H10 :200H2O, was sealed in a 23-ml PTFE-lined stainless steel autoclave and heated at 150 \u00b0C for 48 h under autogeneous pressure. The initial pH of the mixture was about 2.0 and after the reaction the pH did not show any appreciable variation. The resulting product, a mixture of powder and pale greenish single crystals, was filtered under vacuum and dried at ambient temperature. The single crystals were separated easily from the mixture physically under a polarizing microscope. The same reaction mixture at 125 \u00b0C for 96 h yielded a single phasic pale greenish powder, which was identified as the title compound by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), by comparison with the simulated XRD pattern from single crystal data. This sample was used for all other characterizations such as thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and magnetic measurements.

{"input":"Extract these synthesis conditions from the following Metal-Organic Framework (MOF) synthesis description: temperature (highest reaction temp, use 25\u00b0C if not specified), time (longest duration at highest temp), solvent (choose one main solvent, no mixtures or ratios), and one chemical additive (write 'None' if no additive present)\nCuCl2\u00b72H2O (0.09 g, 0.54 mmol) and Na2WO4\u00b72H2O (0.18 g, 0.54 mmol) were dissolved in 20 mL of distilled water under stirring at room temperature for 20 min. Then C6H5PO3H2 (0.10 g, 0.64 mmol) was added to the above solution under stirring, and the pH of the mixture was adjusted to 3\u20134 with 4 mol L\u22121 HCl. Finally, bipy (0.15 g, 0.96 mmol) was added. The resulting mixture was transferred to a 30 mL Teflon-lined autoclave and kept at 150 \u00b0C for 3 days, and then blue block crystals were obtained (yield: ca. 32% based on W).
