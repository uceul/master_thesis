Original text: The reaction of 4,4′-bipyridine with CdSO4·8/3H2O in water in 1:1 mole ratio in a sealed tube at 120°C gave 1 as pure crystalline product in 57% yield. A sample of 256 mg (1.0 mmol) CdSO4·8/3H2O and 156 mg (1.0 mmol) 4,4′-bipyridine was mixed thoroughly and loaded into a thick-walled Pyrex tube. After ∼1.0 ml H2O was added, the tube was frozen with liquid N2, evacuated under vacuum and sealed with a flame. The reaction was carried out at 120°C for 24 h to afford colorless single crystals of 1. The product was isolated by acetone washing in 57% yield. The compound is insoluble in common organic solvents such as THF, acetone, CH2Cl2, and CH3CN or water. The single crystal X-ray structure analysis showed that 1 crystallizes in the C-centered, noncentrosymmetric space group C2 (No. 5). Crystallographic data for 1, C20H28Cd2N4O14S2, monoclinic C2 (No. 5), a=24.624(1), b=9.7554(5), c=13.5956(7) Å, β=120.663(1)°, V=2809.2(2) Å3, Z=4, ρcalc=1.980 g cm−3, μ=1.740 mm−1, T=295 K, structure solution and refinement based on 5239 reflections including Friedel mates (3254 unique) with Io≥3.0σ(Io) converged at R=0.0342, Rw=0.0481 and goodness-of-fit=1.85. Data were collected on a Siemens SMART diffractometer using Mo Kα radiation (λ=0.71073 Å). An empirical absorption correction based on redundant reflections was applied to the data set. The absolute configuration was unambiguously assigned based on the analysis of the Bijovot pairs and the refinement of the Flack parameter. The absence of inversion center in the structure was also confirmed by MISYM. The refinement of Flack parameter for the chosen configuration gave 0.00020(9) with 5239 reflections where Fc(H) and Fc(–H) differ by more than 0.0001. The asymmetric unit contains two Cd2+ ions, two 4,4′-bipy ligands, two SO4 2− anions, and three coordinate and three crystallization water molecules. The metal centers are first linked by the SO4 2− anions to form the one-dimensional arrays of fused 12-membered rings containing three cadmium, three sulfur and six oxygen atoms (see Fig. 1). The arrays are drawn together by hydrogen bonding between the coordinate water molecules and the SO4 2− anions from the adjacent net. The two SO4 2− anions are split into μ2- and μ3-bridging ligands. Thus, Cd(1) is coordinated by a μ2-SO4 2−, a μ3-SO4 2− and two cis-H2O molecules while the Cd(2) is linked by a μ2-SO4 2−, two different μ3-SO4 2− anions and a water. The 4,4′-bipy ligands act as ‘posts’ that connect the cadmium centers to form the one-dimensional [Cd2(4,4′-bipy)2(H2O)3]n 4+ chains. The coordination of both Cd atoms can best be described as slightly distorted octahedral with four O atoms situated in the square plane and two N atoms occupying the axial positions. Fig. 2 depicts the coordination environments of the two Cd atoms. Rather than being parallel, these chains run across each other from two different directions. Thus, the compound forms three-dimensional interwoven networks as shown in Fig. 3. The most common coordination modes of the SO4 2− ion are monodentate, bidentate and μ2-bridging, while μ3-bridging is much less frequent [11]. The combination of both μ2- and μ3-bridging in the same structure is hitherto unreported. The fact that 1 crystallizes in a noncentrosymmetric space group can perhaps be attributed to this unusual combination of the two different bridging modes for the SO4 2− anion. We have noticed that the use of simple, weaker coordinating anions such as NO3 − and ClO4 − results in centrosymmetric more often than noncentrosymmetric crystal packing....

Original text: [Yb2(BDC)3(DMF)2]⋅H2O was synthesised under solvothermal conditions (BDC=benzene‐1,4‐dicarboxylate and DMF=N,N‐dimethylformamide). Ytterbium(III) chloride hexahydrate (1 mmol) and benzene‐1,4‐dicarboxylic acid (15 mmol) were dissolved in DMF (5 mL). To this, H2O (0.15 mL) was added and the mixture stirred until complete dissolution of all reagents had occurred. The reactants were heated in a sealed 20 mL Teflon‐lined autoclave at 100 °C for 20 hours. The resulting white crystalline solid was isolated by suction filtration. In situ crystallisation studies were carried out on Beamline I12 (JEEP) of the Diamond Light Source.16 A specially constructed reaction cell made from polyether ether ketone (PEEK) was used to investigate solvothermal crystallisation: a 5 mL internal volume tube of 12 mm internal diameter that was fitted with a screw‐top lid that allowed moderate pressure to be contained and reactions up to 150 °C to be investigated. An internal thermocouple, threaded through the lid of the reaction tube allowed continuous monitoring of temperature during reactions. The reaction was stirred rapidly with a smaller Teflon‐coated magnetic follower to aid heat transfer and to ensure that uniform solid product was present in the X‐ray beam throughout the experiment. The tube was heated within the ODISC infra‐red furnace,17 with a glassy carbon sheath around the sample to allow heat transfer to the reaction vessel. A wavelength of 0.2242 Å was used and 2D diffraction patterns collected every minute using a Pixium image plate detector (430×430 mm2) with an exposure time of 4000 ms. The system was calibrated with a crystalline CeO2 reference and the 2D image plate data were integrated using the fit2d software to give 1D diffraction patterns.18 The time‐resolved in situ data sets were analysed using sequential Pawley decompositions and Rietveld refinements, as implemented in TOPAS.19 CCDC 1057461 contain the supplementary crystallographic data for this paper.

Original text: The iron arsenate oxalate I was synthesized hydrothermally starting from a mixture containing piperazine. In a typical synthesis, 0.099 g of iron oxalate was dissolved in 2 ml of water followed by the addition of 0.3826 g of As2O5 under continuous stirring. Finally 0.0478 g of piperazine was added and the mixture was homogenized for 30 min at room temperature. The final mixture with the composition, Fe(C2O4).2H2O:3As2O5:C4N2H10 :200H2O, was sealed in a 23-ml PTFE-lined stainless steel autoclave and heated at 150 °C for 48 h under autogeneous pressure. The initial pH of the mixture was about 2.0 and after the reaction the pH did not show any appreciable variation. The resulting product, a mixture of powder and pale greenish single crystals, was filtered under vacuum and dried at ambient temperature. The single crystals were separated easily from the mixture physically under a polarizing microscope. The same reaction mixture at 125 °C for 96 h yielded a single phasic pale greenish powder, which was identified as the title compound by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), by comparison with the simulated XRD pattern from single crystal data. This sample was used for all other characterizations such as thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and magnetic measurements. EDAX analysis gave an Fe:As ratio of 1:1.5 which matches with the composition obtained from the single-crystal X-ray study....
